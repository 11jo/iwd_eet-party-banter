@1150 = ~That is... Erevain. Oh my dear cousin. He never was content to stay home, to remain in Evereska where it was safe. I suppose... I suppose it was only a matter of time. But the event being inevitable does not make it easier to endure. I will mourn for you tonight and each night until I can bring news to our homeland. Farewell for the last time, Erevain~

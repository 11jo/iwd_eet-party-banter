## Icewind Dale in EET Party Banter
*****************************************

#### A mod for tipun's IWD in EET mod


### Compatibility :

- Install after Setup-iwd1_eet and Setup-iwd2_eet but before both iwd_eet_end and EET_end mods


### Introduction :

This mod adds interjections and area comments to every base companion in both BG1 and BG2 (including Beamdog NPCs) to the IWD campaign. This should make the IWD campaign much more lively for those playing it as part of their EET playthroughs.

-About 2000 lines added as interjections during npc dialogue or area comments.

-IWD2 only has very limited interjections (only in Targos). This may be expanded on in a future release.

-SOD companions are not included. 

### Installation :

Download iwd_eet-party-banter.zip and unzip the mod into your Baldur’s Gate 2 directory where you have EET installed, making sure that the folder “iwd_eet-party-banter” and file Setup-iwd_eet-party-banter is in your base game directory (the same location as the chitin.key. Run the Setup-iwd_eet-party-banter weidu exe file to start installation.

Note:
The mod should only be played on a fresh save. Uninstalling the mod and loading up a save that had been installed will probably not totally break your save, but may result in weirdness.

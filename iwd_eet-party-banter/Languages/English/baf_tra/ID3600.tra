@950  = ~Such picturesque mountains, such desolate snowy plains! I feel a song welling up inside me. Over hill and into icey dales; our valiant troupe we would not fail! Through snow and ice our resolve grew strong! Not the least bit because of my great new soooong! Oh whereâ€™s my pen, I need to start writing this down!~ // Garrick
@951  = ~Boo does not look to have grown out his winter coat yet and has retreated even deeper into my armor than normal. Fear not Boo! I have sat naked upon the cold plains of Rashemen in winter for days at a time! My body has warmth enough for both of us. Just... watch where you nibble!~ // Minsc

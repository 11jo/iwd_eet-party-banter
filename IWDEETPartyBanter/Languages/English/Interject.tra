@10000 = ~Oh dear! Come quickly here. We will not let any monsters hurt you. Hurry!~
@10001 = ~Like taking candy from a baby... well, fish from a baby. Oh nevermind...~
@10002 = ~If you would like your fish back, you must fight me for it boy. You can only truly say you own something when you can kill anyone who would take it from you.~
@10003 = ~Excuse me little one, but just in case you should possibly consider procuring a good crossbow to defend yourself with in the future. And it just so happens that I have a range of high quality and disputably legal bolts just for you! Imagine the next time a yeti comes into town only for BAM! A Jansen patented flash master bruiser mate to strike him blind. Why you and your friends could simply beat him with sticks into submission after! Just don't tell your dad you got these from me ok?~
@10004 = ~Oh that's so neat! Pew pew Yetis you're dead haha!~
@10005 = ~Oh... it just brings a tear to this gnome's heart to see a child empowered by slightly illegal ammunition. Remember don't tell your dad!~
@10006 = ~That slack face, that distant stare. This is a dreamer my raven. A man who lives in blissful imagination. It would pain me to pull him from reverie, but do as you will.~
@10007 = ~A distressing thought for one's dreams to rebel against the mind. We should consider helping this man to quell the unquiet within him.~
@10008 = ~Ah, but it was our pleasure. Voices from the deep are never to be entertained with anything but healthy caution and fear. It is to your benefit you know this.~
@10009 = ~An inversion of the expected outcome is it? You have made the tragedy a satire and turned it on its head. Though I prefer the bittersweet myself. Better to dream and long for a thing that cannot be than flee in fear from a thing that isn't there.~
@10010 = ~Well that was a very... disappointing conclusion to this story. Maybe I'll leave this one out of the songs altogether...~
@10011 = ~Such a gullible fool. Just like all surfacers their first reaction to all things they do not understand is to run and hide. ~
@10012 = ~I think I'll take the next caravan to Targos.~
@10013 = ~And now finally freed from the songs in his dreams that tormented him, this hound will spend his nights howling in torment by the silence of their absence. A breathtakingly tragic climax.~
@10014 = ~I think I'll miss it too. I only just heard it the once, but it's not something you ever forget. Maybe I'll might write a song about it.~
@10015 = ~A song about a song? No one is going to want to listen to that.~
@10016 = ~*sigh* You're probably right.*~
@10017 = ~Such sentimentality is a bore. There are always more maidens out there. Let me assure you that any strumpet's song will do when it is sung in the bedchambers. Once that entertains your thoughts, you'll forget this whole tiresome affair.~
@10018 = ~I'm sorry, what was that?~
@10019 = ~Always search for true love my friend! True love and nothing else for anything but is a fleeting dream. True love lasts forever as I've found with my... true... love... here (Ugh, it hurts even to say)~
@10020 = ~Oh Eldoth you're such a romantic!~
@10021 = ~The enchantments on this blade were well hidden in its shattered state. It seems that Jhonen was the missing trigger to activate them and reform the blade. I doubt it will be enough to turn the tide of this battle, but we can use all the help we can get.~
@10022 = ~It seems that all the blade needed to reform itself was Jhonen's presence. If it's keyed to his ancestry, that makes sense. I'm not sure the enchantment will hold if we stray far from Easthaven, but right now that's probably not the biggest concern.~
@10023 = ~Tis but a refreshing spring breeze. Ahh I've never breathed so clearly in my life.~
@10024 = ~Bah! Buncha rot. Superstitions be damned, somethin' in that tower needs killin and I'll nae let evil intent keep me axe from its skull.~
@10025 = ~For once I find myself in agreement with Korgan. No matter the evil within that tower we must march forward.~
@10026 = ~You can feel it pressing around you like ice water in the deepest of lakes.~
@10027 = ~What a clumsy mistake. The locking mechanism was no doubt damaged in his haste. It shouldn't be terribly difficult to undo it, though I think I'd rather see one of the strapping men here throw themselves into the door instead.~
@10028 = ~This door is no match for Minsc! He will charge at it head first with berserker fury!~
@10029 = ~For example...~
@10030 = ~Ha! Frightened by even the feeblest of nature's creatures. We should throw you back into your shop and let you "sort things out" with this wolf as you can.~
@10031 = ~You're more savage than the beast I locked inside!~
@10032 = ~It'd be a start heh heh! No such thing as a free lunch you ingrate. Pay up or the wolf stays where it is.~
@10033 = ~Isn't it fascinating how people live up here? I doubt it would be much different even in our time. I've seen men with more wealth than they could count live the lives of miserable paupers. But here, people take what little they are given and make do with it. If only such humble aspirations could be shared by everyone.~
@10034 = ~She's so beautiful. But also really sad. There's something ‘bout her that just makes me wanna hug her tight and tell her it'll be alright.~
@10035 = ~Oh, you wish to "hug" her do you? The way you are entranced by her pitiful song, it appears that it is only the start of what you want from her.~
@10036 = ~Heh well, uhhh maybe you learn to sing half so good and I'll even be interested in givin' you a hug too.~
@10037 = ~You flatter yourself if you think I'd allow it.~
@10038 = ~Sure thing Viccy. You keep playin' that heart of stone thing you got goin on. Obviously it's workin for ya.~
@10039 = ~Aww did you make yourself blue? I once cast a spell that made my skin a really disgusting shade of green. I was a complete eyesore for like a week until I was finally able to dispel it. Some people even thought I was part orc and tried to set me on fire. Good times.~
@10040 = ~Sweet is the song she sings. So sweet, it pains me to hear it, but I cannot help but listen.~
@10041 = ~Her song... it is pleasing to the ear. But there is a dread as well and I feel like I might be drowning. The sweetest death so they say, and by they, I mean complete idiots who think any death could be sweet.~
@10042 = ~Greetings m'lady. Might I say, your skin is such a fine shade of blue. I dare say I've seen many exotic women in my time, but none attracted the eye so favorably as you. ~
@10043 = ~Ahh the Dreamer's dilemma takes shape before us. I sense a longing, a lingering love in her tune my raven. ~
@10044 = ~She cannot stray from the lake... or she shouldn't. Please don't, as much as your heart longs for it. You cannot imagine how far you can fall...~
@10045 = ~*She nods knowingly, sadly.*~
@10046 = ~This whole run around between this blue waif and her dopey fisher-love is enough to make me puke. But hard to argue with cold payment.~
@10047 = ~We seem to be skirting the edges of history here! I've not heard of the tales of the dragon Icasaracht but it seems like this was a very important event. I wonder if this isn't the last we'll see of this story.~
@10048 = ~You mean to fuel this man's addictions? He has a problem. We'd be better off helping by ignoring his request.~
@10049 = ~Whatarya? Some kinda... tiny paladin? Or have I jus been drinkin' so much you look tiny... oOooooOOOOooo....~
@10050 = ~Hmph.~
@10051 = ~I do not feel right about feeding this man more wine. He's very obviously had his fill and needs to learn to abstain. Let us not carry this out.~
@10052 = ~Pfff Paladin, who asked ya!? Paladins always ruinin' my fun.~
@10053 = ~Ugh, leave this drunk to his hole. There's work to be done.~
@10054 = ~Well, at least one person has the right of the situation. Just watch the shoes old chap.~
@10055 = ~Hmm this Hrothgar seems to be a man who, despite having no official standing in the town, takes a great deal of responsibility for it.~
@10056 = ~It would be more productive for him to simply state this business he has for us here rather than later... ah well.~
@10057 = ~He thinks he protects these people? Ha! They live or die on Tiax's whims. He would do well to learn that...~
@10058 = ~This man s-seems good of heart and sincere in his w-wishes. I think I would l-l-like to hear what he has to say. After we've explored the town of course.~
@10059 = ~Oh this is the start to another great legend! Tired travelers crowding together by the heat of the hearth in a strange town... a man of heroic proportions and uhh... heroism asks them for help! I have little doubt the business he supposes will lead us on a long and fruitful journey!~
@10060 = ~...~
@10061 = ~Don't be daft <CHARNAME>! Oh, I apologize on <PRO_HISHER> behalf me lady. Dwarven women aren't so common topside, though t'isn't an excuse for poor manners.~
@10062 = ~And a fine beard it be... Just the right amount o' curls to hold on tight ta while... *unintelligible noises*~
@10063 = ~Ugh, away from me. Ye make me ill.~
@10064 = ~Way to endear yourself to the natives Korgan...~
@10065 = ~Hit him on the nose with a blunt object if he continues to do that. He hasn't quite been housebroken yet.~
@10066 = ~Please accept my apology on the behalf of my... uncouth companion.~
@10067 = ~Killing pests from this old bag's cellar just for a drink? How insipid... You don't mind if I sit this one out do you? Pest removal is simply not one of my numerous talents.~
@10068 = ~Surely this woman is so rotund we could simply roll her down the stairs to crush the vermin below? What? I'm just thinking for efficiency's sake here!~
@10069 = ~Hmm burrowing insects in this climate... Surely a large beetle of some kind. I used to collect beetles when I was a boy but... I suppose now is not the time.~
@10070 = ~This all feels like the humble beginnings of someone else's story. I've stolen my fair share of things but I dunno how comfortable I feel stealing legends.~
@10071 = ~Hmm... Enough coin to buy another round. Well, a victory is a victory. Let us drink to celebrate our courageous battle against those small and mostly defenseless insects.~
@10072 = ~Yes, let us drink now, for the next battle shall surely be our last.~
@10073 = ~And just like that, the desire is gone. Leave it to you to kill the mood in record speed Xan.~
@10074 = ~I live to exceed your expectations.~
@10075 = ~A man who also bears the trappings of refinement in this savage land...(though his extravagant display is no doubt entirely for show with no real power behind it)~
@10076 = ~Aha! An enthusiasm I also share when I am treated to travelers on my surgical table. It is important that guests should feel welcome. Hehehe....~
@10077 = ~Ah, HAH HAH. You're a real joker aren't ya?~
@10078 = ~I do try, however my patients are ever so grim. Tis torture to get a laugh from them.~
@10079 = ~HA! Torture! That's a good one!~
@10080 = ~Ho there Erevain Blacksheaf. I am Kivan of Shilmistra. It is good to see another of the fair folk so far afield.~
@10081 = ~E... Erevain? You are here?~
@10082 = ~Xan? Cousin? Well isn't this a surprise! You know me, always in for a spot of adventure. If anyone needs to explain themselves it's you. I didn't think the Greycloaks would ever get you out of your tower.~
@10083 = ~They asked me to investigate some foreign concerns here. Very umm... very secret mission. So here I am, improbably at the far ends of Faerun.~
@10084 = ~What's wrong Xan? Why I dare say you look unusually pale, even to your snowy complexion.~
@10085 = ~The frigid air here is truly horrendous. I have had a cough for the last several days and the leaking of my nose is incessent. It has left me quite miserable.~
@10086 = ~Well, at least you're giving it a try. I hope you aren't getting your companions too down.~
@10087 = ~I needn't bother. The hopelessness of our quest is self-evident.~
@10088 = ~Never change Xan.~
@10089 = ~...Erevain, you know your father has forgiven you. You needn't be on this quest. If you'd just but go home...~
@10090 = ~And let you take all the glory of exploring this untamed wild? Ah, I could never live with myself. Besides... I think I need this time away. It's best for everyone.~
@10091 = ~I understand. Farewell Erevain.~
@10092 = ~And you as well Xan. I'll see you back in Evereska.~
@10093 = ~Should we both make it. I'll not dare to hope but... perhaps.~
@10094 = ~An ominous premonition. Nature voices her discomfort loudly to those who know how to listen. I do wonder... this expedition seems to relate to Kuldahar. Perhaps this is all related and is our ultimate reason for being here.~
@10095 = ~Ah tis good of you to take up the cause even with such beliefs. The womenfolk of the realms are just as impacted by the battles throughout the Realms as men. Tis only right they learn to participate directly as is Tempus' will. I have had to deal with much scorn myself, but tis only made me stronger for it!~
@10096 = ~I see that in your poise. Fight well in the name of Tempus as an example for all of us.~
@10097 = ~Why am I not surprised to hear the men of the barbarian tribes are as foolish as any other? Should we encounter any, I will be sure to show them what woman-wielded steel can do, first hand.~
@10098 = ~The fire in your heart is... admirable, but remember that Tempus teaches us we should not fight battles without considering if such battles are necessary.~
@10099 = ~Stuff your considerations. I'll be out there giving men the steel they deserve right where they deserve it and doing more for the better sex than you ever will kneeling at the altar of your male god.~
@10100 = ~It is a sad state of affairs that such people are unable to accept a stable peace. One more sign that Helm's presence is not felt here as well as it should.~
@10101 = ~It is perhaps a justified suspicion. I have little doubt that southern immigrants have imposed as much harm on them with their "civilization" as the barbarians have with their "savagery".~
@10102 = ~It's not that simple.~
@10103 = ~No, it never is.~
@10104 = ~Hold Everard. We do not mean to question your faith or your service to your god. It is a simple fact that many who cannot fight must watch instead. There is no shame in this.~
@10105 = ~You may be my senior in age, but your faith is not my own Tormite. It is not the same.~
@10106 = ~Perhaps. It will not be spoken of further.~
@10107 = ~Ha! This priest of "war" hides in his temple while sterner men go off to battle. Your weakness is disgusting.~
@10108 = ~Your insults mean nothing to me. Go speak your drivel to someone interested in it.~
@10109 = ~*The* Jarrod? Here? His glorious battle lives on in the annals of all mine faith... I must speak a prayer in silence... but please <CHARNAME> if you hadst not heard the tale yet, please ask further. Tis a great story and should be known by all!~
@10110 = ~*giggles* I've never seen Branny so excited before. It's so cute!~
@10111 = ~Don't fangirl too hard or anything...~
@10112 = ~A desperate maneuver of a fool whose control of the situation was so clearly lost. He was a fool to not negotiate a deal beforehand as a contingency, as the devils would be bound to obey it.~
@10113 = ~Clearly the man was beyond madness at that point to summon upon the Hells so recklessly. Ha! The field must have erupted in fire and blood. It would have been an entertaining sight at least.~
@10114 = ~Aye, that'd be a show worth watchin. And when the watchin was done, mayhaps worth wadin in ta see how many devils ya could kill before death finally came to ya.~
@10115 = ~The desperate often have visions of their gods parading before them and inspiring them to one insane act or another. Quite a difference from the Underdark. There, seeing your god in a moment of desperation usually is a portent of imminent doom.~
@10116 = ~He obviously felt very strongly at the time, and because of what he did the world is saved. It seems unfair to judge him so harshly now...~
@10117 = ~‘Tis possible Tempus did not require Jerrod to sacrifice so. But none but Tempus can say. ‘Twas a valiant sacrifice nonetheless and must have been blessed by Tempus to have succeeded so.~
@10118 = ~Overwhelmed by the forces of hell, survival seeming ever hopeless, he simply threw himself into the portal? A story I can relate to keenly. Though I doubt my death will have as much meaning.~
@10119 = ~This archdruid trusted a human to carry his message? Feh, the the druids of the north are just as misguided as those heretical circles in the south. ~
@10120 = ~If the next words outta yer mouth are that ye spilled the beans, me blade's gonna sit real comfortable in yer throat old man...~
@10121 = ~Oh... well that's not good. That's... what's the opposite of the best thing ever? Cause it's pretty much that.~
@10122 = ~He seeketh to unlock Jerrod's Stone and undo his noble sacrifice? We must stop him, whatever the cost!~
@10123 = ~Dare not die on the way there. We may need you yet and I'll not suffer your weakness to be the end of us.~
@10124 = ~Haha! Stupid priest! Your blood is required for Tiax's ascendence. You die now!~
@10125 = ~You're...mad...~
@10126 = ~I never do tire of putting down tired old priests.~
@10127 = ~Vile... Blackguard...~
@10128 = ~Ooo look at all this neat stuff. Oh is that a stuffed minotaur's head?! Can I touch it? Can I? Pleaaaase...~
@10129 = ~I see no reason why not. Do you need me to give you a boost?~
@10130 = ~Yippeee!~
@10131 = ~I see here trinkets from as far as far east as Taan and... is this a fetish from Zakhara? Oh ho my friend, if one's life is measured by the span of land they've traveled, you have lived quite the full one.~
@10132 = ~Boo wonders if we will still be kicking butt when we are old. Of course little Boo! Even when I must use my sword to lean on and your fur is grey, Minsc and Boo will still stand strong and crush all evil things that rear their ugly head!~
@10133 = ~T'would take more than age to slow you down my Minsc.~
@10134 = ~Aha! Yes! He will kick evil butt and protect his witch, for all time!~
@10135 = ~*sigh* If only it could be thus...~
@10136 = ~Good to hear that you've kept yourself busy! A life of peaceful sentimentality may be attractive to some but it is heartening that the romance of adventure can still beat full in your heart even in your advanced human age.~
@10137 = ~Heh. I may be old, but I am not dead.~
@10138 = ~Knowin' <CHARNAME> I'm surprised <PRO_HESHE> hasn't smelled adventure that way already and started on without ya.~
@10139 = ~I do not like the sound of this. I think we have an obligation to join with this man, and at least see what these "evil forces" are all about first hand. Helm would not approve a lapse of vigilance in this regard.~
@10140 = ~If thou are't certain that this is the path we should take, then I stand beside you, whatever reservations I might have.~
@10141 = ~Minsc will always stand by his witch, and Boo will always stand by him! Even the thickest snow will not hide evil from us!~
@10142 = ~We might be able to do some good up here while we can. We should try at least.~
@10143 = ~I've got it! We'll check out what's been going on in Kuldahar. For now we'll have to accompany this Hrothgar guy, we can just ditch him once we're through the pass though. He would probably just weigh us down with his inferior intelligence.~
@10144 = ~Protectin' caravans be a dull trade. Well, lets see what money he's offerin'... I ain't seein a better chance fer bloodshed yet.~
@10145 = ~Are we traveling even further into the north? Well, maybe this would be a good time to shop for some even colder weather wear? Or some better boots. I think I need better boots...~
@10146 = ~Now now Skie, I seem to recall just getting you a new pair of shoes shortly before we left. Let's not be greedy.~
@10147 = ~But those shoes were so last season... I can't be seen wearing them now.~
@10148 = ~It would be an honor to procure a new pair of shoes for you m'lady.~
@10149 = ~Better your wallet than mine.~
@10150 = ~Well, y-you know that I am willing <CHARNAME>. This sounds like a noble c-cause and I'd be happy t-to lend my arm to it.~
@10151 = ~<CHARNAME>, I'd like for us to travel with this man. I know little of this area but I feel that there is something important happening here... something that deeply threatens the balance of this region... and perhaps even beyond.~
@10152 = ~Be that b-b-because of your druid's senses?~
@10153 = ~No, simple intuition is all. You know I am always right in such things~
@10154 = ~Of c-course dear.~
@10155 = ~I must admit, I have heard some tales of the great tree of Kuldahar and would be interested in seeing it. As wolves in the winter, we would be prudent to travel as part of a pack.~
@10156 = ~A few days? A few days?! My considerably valuable time has already been taxed as is. This delay is unacceptable.~
@10157 = ~Attacked by bandits, orcs, or goblins probably. Easy pickings unless they have a regiment of guards worth their salt. And hiring help that can defend themselves is usually more than the cost of goods themselves. If it were me, I'd just send them as cheap as possible and eat the losses when they happen.~
@10158 = ~Is that all lives are t-to you? M-m-math?~
@10159 = ~When that math translates to gold in my pocket, you better believe it twerp.~
@10160 = ~Hmm... navigating the hills may be difficult, but the snow should make the comings and goings of caravans easy to track. ~
@10161 = ~I am unused to tracking in environments such as these. Perhaps it will serve to learn by doing however.~
@10162 = ~Minsc and Boo will find this caravan for you! And if something bad has happened, Boo's nose is very sensitive to naughtiness. He will lead us straight to the buttocks of evil so that we may give it a swift kick!~
@10163 = ~Is wandering around in the ice and snow going to be a thing we start doing? I think I deserve a bit extra of the share of whatever gold we earn from this. The extravagance of the salt bath my feet will need when we return will be substantial. ~
@10164 = ~Ah, but if your feet should ever become sore, I would be glad to tend to them.~
@10165 = ~Darling, hot salt bath first, then *maybe* we can discuss the matter of you so much as laying a finger on my feet.~
@10166 = ~Orcs prey on the vulnerable, it is just their nature. None of their butcherous actions surprise me. It brought me only the smallest satisfaction to pay their violence back upon them.~
@10167 = ~Ever so grim my brother. Ah, but you do have a point, the area will be safer without them.~
@10168 = ~It could be a number of things, however travelers can at least rest easier knowing the pass will be free of orcish aggression for a while.~
@10169 = ~Aye, it was a job well done on all counts.~
@10170 = ~Something worth investigating perhaps after we return from Kuldahar. I wouldn't want to leave a job half done.~
@10171 = ~How much wine is on that list? We should triple whatever old Hrothgar here thinks is necessary. No wait, quintuple. I have a powerful thirst and meniality only makes it stronger.~
@10172 = ~The bard's nature is boorish but I am in agreement. One cannot underestimate the benefits of drink in dulling unpleasant company.~
@10173 = ~Only the mind, but t'was a casualty of an avalanche long before this one.~
@10174 = ~Somehow, inexplicably, we have avoided death yet again. Though the shock of our survival may overwhelm my heart yet.~
@10175 = ~HEY XAN ARE YOU OK?!~
@10176 = ~Hurk! Wh-whe-who...?! Oh... it's just you. Yes, gods yes, I'm fine.~
@10177 = ~Just makin sure! *giggles*~
@10178 = ~Away from me rivvil! The avalanche would be a comforting embrace next to your revolting concern.~
@10179 = ~That's Viccy's way of saying 'I'm swell, gee thanks for askin'!~
@10180 = ~I t-think we are alright. T-that w-was a c-c-close one. Oh b-but... the others...~
@10181 = ~Steady yourself Khalid. We made it. *I* made it. Listen to my voice... we are ok.~
@10182 = ~Y-yes dear... yes. I hear you. Thank the g-gods you're ok.~
@10183 = ~It seems that luck was indeed on our side. Even for adventurers as seasoned as ourselves, one can still fall victim to a clever trap laid by a foe at a superior vantage.~
@10184 = ~Such are the tricks of craven villains. Were they to face us honorably, ours would have been the upper hand.~
@10185 = ~Ah but Anomen my friend, that is exactly why they did not face us on even ground. A wise tactician only goes to war when they can be certain they've secured victory before the fight has started.~
@10186 = ~I'd expect as much from a rogue such as you.~
@10187 = ~Ah, such is the way of things. We live now, so I suppose there still is chance for us to find the fair fight you so desire.~
@10188 = ~We're fine but... Hrothgar and the others... I think *sniff* I d-don't think we can go back for them...~
@10189 = ~I cannot believe this! My coat is ruined. That was... I got that from my father. Maybe... maybe I'm better off without it but... no this is just not good.~
@10190 = ~Your concern is unneeded. Tiax cannot be felled by any mere act of nature. Cyric would not permit it while his ascension still approaches. Ohhh but his toes are FREEZING. UNACCEPTABLE!~
@10191 = ~Please my friend, responsible though you may have not been, show a little respect at least. They deserved that much.~
@10192 = ~Hey that wasn't a very nice thing to say! Did the cave moss you licked his morning give you bad gas or something? You should be a bit nicer.~
@10193 = ~Aye, tis job for a gravedigger an' this group certainly ain't payin' me enough fer such a task. Besides, snow's as good as dirt fer the dead.~
@10194 = ~If you cannot appreciate the beauty of a "big tree" then it would be better to rip the eyes from your miserable skull to save you from their burden.~
@10195 = ~Hmph yes, just a "big tree" certainly. We'll be sure to take your astute appraisal to heart.~
@10196 = ~Yeah, we weren't asking for a pamphlet on all the attractions there. Jeez, no wonder this guy lives on his own out in a cave.~
@10197 = ~Well that's just fine. Me axe is hungrin' fer a bit ‘o payback ‘n it nae be picky about who's footin' the bill.~
@10198 = ~Damn giants! I'll kill every last one of them if it's the last thing I do! The goblins will have to do as an appetizer.~
@10199 = ~Goblins in the pass? Perhaps there is some link between them and the giants. Though I cannot promise I will stay Helm's wrath long enough for ask, if any would even talk.~
@10200 = ~That our course is impeded multiplely seems quite far from chance. These threads dangle from a single point, though we may need pluck a few to see from where.~
@10201 = ~No no, I am quite certain that all goblins are, in fact, idiots.~
@10202 = ~Certainly this one represents a paragon of his race. Shall we kill him now or did you want to teach him some tricks?~
@10203 = ~MINSC WILL CRUSH EVI... little goblin is just hungry? Boo gets irritable when he is hungry too. Maybe goblin is not so evil?~
@10204 = ~Aye my big friend. The world is rarely so black and white as it seems.~
@10205 = ~There's some sort of enchantment on this creature. I can feel it, but I'm not certain of the source. What would compel a goblin so?~
@10206 = ~Are you really insisting we entertain the problems of a goblin? The power required to shackle a goblin's will is not exactly impressive.~
@10207 = ~One thing we can assume however is this is likely a... wide ranging effect. No one would expend the effort to willingly dominate a few goblins. I mean... they're goblins.~
@10208 = ~Yer head hurts now? But me hammer hasn't even struck it yet!~
@10209 = ~Already hit head on wall. It not work. But maybe hammer work? Little man hit head with hammer?~
@10210 = ~Now ye askin me to hit it? I'll be a bearded gnome if I know what to make of this at all!~
@10211 = ~I don't know about making his head feel better but severing it from his neck should at least stop his crying.~
@10212 = ~Aww poor guy. I know he's an ogre ‘n all, but I just feel bad for him.~
@10213 = ~An ogre is not worth your pity. Unfortunate his plight may be, he is still a monster.~
@10214 = ~Even if that's the case, it just ain't my way Kivan. My heart won't let it.~
@10215 = ~Hmm...  I may know just the remedy for this condition. It is up to you if you wish to give help to him. While many times violent, ogres are still a part of the delicate balance of nature. I believe that should be respected as long as this one does not attack us.~
@10216 = ~Brilliant. You've helped a poor ogre come to his senses. Surely now he won't resume his routine of crushing hapless travelers under his club. Yes, what a noble thing you've done today waeles.~
@10217 = ~Releasing this creature will no doubt serve the balance by knocking off a few 'civilized' travelers.~
@10218 = ~Now I just feel all warm and fuzzy inside. I hope you feel better mister ogre. Uh, please don't kill people anymore ok?~
@10219 = ~Agh! Must go. Get out of way!~
@10220 = ~Ha! Haha! An amusing jest for your lord. Now the time for jests is over! You will bow before TIAX and pay HIM tribute!~
@10221 = ~Treat not with his foul kind. He deserves nothing better than an arrow in the heart.~
@10222 = ~Really?~
@10223 = ~Pftfh hahaha. I guess when you're a demi-god, it's ok to have a few moments of eccentricity.~
@10224 = ~Ok real funny. Now kill the orc and give me back that gold you just took from me. I ain't interested in no orc charity.~
@10225 = ~Take it, take it please just don't hurt me and my beautiful brain!~
@10226 = ~Uhh... I think you mighta misclicked or something there boss.~
@10227 = ~Oh... I'm sorry. We've taken care of the goblins, you can come out. Don't worry.~
@10228 = ~What's that there? Oh little tyke, no need to worry now. Quayle won't hurt you.~
@10229 = ~Are... are you sure?~
@10230 = ~As sure as I'm the smartest person you've ever met. I *know* there's nothing else for you to worry about.~
@10231 = ~Is it... is it safe?~
@10232 = ~I do not like the idea of letting this child go unattended, especially given the horrifying events that have transpired here. But I suppose there's not much to be done about it now.~
@10233 = ~A fine young lad. He hath been touched by war and seems to not dwell overmuch on his loss of kin. Tis my hope he finds strength in his hardship.~
@10234 = ~You know, even though he's lost his home, his livelihood, everyone he's loved, and now has to live in a boring temple as an orphan where he faces an uncertain future, he doesn't seem all that sad about it.~
@10235 = ~That's great!~
@10236 = ~Oh aye, an I knew we'd be accosted by wee minnows soon as we set foot ‘neath this blasted tree.~
@10237 = ~I'm just content that we were finally able to find some shade.~
@10238 = ~Can I just quickly voice how uncomfortable I am that this majesty of nature will serve as shelter from an unholy perversion of nature?~
@10239 = ~Certainly if you'd like to elaborate further. I am always interested in listening to what a wise druid has to say.~
@10240 = ~...No, that about covers it really.~
@10241 = ~Thanks kid! I knew we'd make it through too.~
@10242 = ~Is this the welcoming parade? Just wonderful...~
@10243 = ~Sniveling rivvil child. We nearly die getting here and he complains?~
@10244 = ~One need not an army to accomplish great things. I think this Arundel may be surprised.~
@10245 = ~Uhh... well ok, whatever you say mister.~
@10246 = ~Fear not little one! Minsc and Boo and friends are more mighty than most armies!~
@10247 = ~Wow! You're really big. Maybe you're right...~
@10248 = ~If he was so smart, why would he waste his time talking to animals? Doesn't he know that animals have small, insignificant brains? That doesn't sound like a very smart thing to me.~
@10249 = ~Guess I never thought about it that way...~
@10250 = ~Remember to always question your elders. They are almost always very stupid. If you keep doing that, you could even be as smart as me some day!~
@10251 = ~This Arundel must be the High Druid tending to this tree and the town. No one would be more aware of the events of the region than him. I would advise going to see him immediately.~
@10252 = ~Twins? No way! Do you two finish each other's sentences and know what each other's thinking? Do you ever wear each other's clothes and pretend to be the other one? Have you ever fallen in love with the same girl?! Listen <CHARNAME> I know we're busy on our mission or whatever but we have GOT to investigate this further!~
@10253 = ~Ahh... really we're not that interesting.~
@10254 = ~You know I had a twin once. Went by Naj Jansen he did. We looked the same in every way but were opposite in every other. I became a salesman, he worked charity. I liked tinkering and inventing, he was an artist. I had an appreciation of fine root based vegetables, and he had a hankering for collard greens. I had the clever wit and charm... and well he had neither of those things.~
@10255 = ~Anyways, the day came where our mother only had love for one of us you see, so we had to compete in a number of activities, with the loser of the majority of them exiled to the Stormy Peaks of Yoh to be raised (or more likely devoured) by wandering griffins. Ah, it was in the game of Truth telling where I finally gained the upper hand. You see, just as I am quite allergic to lies, so was Naj unable to tell a truth without coming down with a severe rash. And so we set him off with little more than a bag of broccoli and spinach to live off of. Never saw him again *sniff*~
@10256 = ~Sometimes I really miss that damned shapeshifter. Oh, I did mention he was a doppelganger didn't I?~
@10257 = ~Wait... I'm confused...~
@10258 = ~Don't think about it too hard. Or hardly at all. He just does that.~
@10259 = ~A temple to Ilmater here? A peculiar god to be sure. But many are the injuries of valiant warriors that have been tended by their faith. They are always welcome sight for any follower of Tempus!~
@10260 = ~A temple to the Broken God here? I did not expect that. One would think there is little shared ground between Ilmater and Arundel's druids, but I suppose necessity and a harsh environment creates strong bonds between unlikely partners.~
@10261 = ~It matters little how this arrangement came about, the worshippers of Ilmater are a welcome sight for any battle-weary traveler.~
@10262 = ~Aye tis true, and I'll not question our fortune finding them here.~
@10263 = ~Haha! There's some mettle to this man afterall. Come broken priest and die on my sword!~
@10264 = ~AHHHH!~
@10265 = ~Why be ya chasin ‘em this way then ya damn fool? Get ye gone and yer yetis too!~
@10266 = ~Quickly sir, fall behind us. We will defend you from this beast!~
@10267 = ~Ahhh! Help meeee!~
@10268 = ~You have m-my condolences. I am s-sure we can retrieve this heirloom for you.~
@10269 = ~Do not let my friend's stammer here leave you lacking confidence. He's a kind heart and will no doubt ensure we collect this heirloom during our eventual excursion.~
@10270 = ~Foul beast. Fear not my fellow, I will ensure that your brother has been avenged for our path will no doubt lead to the Vale shortly.~
@10271 = ~Good. I expect a decent payout for our time. We are all outta ‘spineless fop' discounts.~
@10272 = ~That's not a bad idea if you don't mind skinning and handling their disgusting hides. Shall we pull straws for it? I just so happen to have some with me. Ah look, and I've already pulled a long straw. Who wants to go next?~
@10273 = ~We won't be too long. I hope we can give you some closure at least, even if we can't bring your brother back. Stay safe.~
@10274 = ~Aye, thank you m'lady.~
@10275 = ~(Just as easily as it can be seen by your own cloth and bearings that you are a simple peasant at home kneeling in the dirt) Ahem, we may if your goods have worth shopkeeper. ~
@10276 = ~Oh a fellow history enthusiast! You could say I also collect and preserve things from time past, I just carry them as stories and songs rather than physical items. I'd love to see your collection and hear the histories behind them.~
@10277 = ~A bard huh? Well, most local lore might be a bit of a bore compared to stories of dragons and knights and all that, but folk tales carry their own important lessons and regional histories that are important for...~
@10278 = ~Oh, I was actually hoping for something with dragons.~
@10279 = ~...kids these days.~
@10280 = ~You'll take that useless tra... err those historically important relics off our hands for gold? Sir, I think we can come to an arrangement here...~
@10281 = ~Ah perhaps give some thought before pawning off time-lost artifacts? Once we return to Athkatla, I know of a few auction houses that might secure us a small fortune from them.~
@10282 = ~Oh I know he's a goblin but... he doesn't look like he's dangerous. Let's just leave him be ok?~
@10283 = ~Eww... how could anyone stand to have a goblin as a servant? It's all... ugly and gross... Servants should be presentable and be able to reach the higher cabinets for things that are out of reach.~
@10284 = ~Eh, I prefer my servants small. They eat less, can crawl into hard to get into spaces, and usually don't expect as much pay.~
@10285 = ~That's... a good point. I think?~
@10286 = ~Such subservience is to be expected of his kind. I'd care not for this gol's well being but killing another's slave is a grave offense, at least among my former people. Let us continue and not suffer his disgusting appearance any longer.~
@10287 = ~I remember when my gol attendent was killed by a freak accident in a knife-throwing contest. It was enjoyable flaying his killer alive, but it was so hard to find a head flat enough to balance fruit on afterwards.~
@10288 = ~A goblin wizard?? Ha! Haha! What a ridiculous notion! This almost makes this whole wretched journey worth it.~
@10289 = ~You know, despite the fact that he obviously wants to use his powers for evil, I can't help but root for the little guy. Go get'em Weenog!~
@10290 = ~Oh could you imagine a little goblin wand in his hand and a pointy hat on his big head? That would be so adorable! I should commission someone to make a little stuffed Weenog... this could be a big hit.~
@10291 = ~Ya know... for half a flower-picker, you ain't wrong about that. Lets talk later about manufacturing and distribution.~
@10292 = ~I feel an odd kinship with this man. He has a perspective sadly lacking in most.~
@10293 = ~Seeing as your tower is located in this town, I must disagree with you on that point. Anything that threatens this town threatens you as well. Even speaking strictly from pragmatism you must value your surroundings more than that.~
@10294 = ~Had I not contingencies prepared that would transport me immediately to a sanctuary far from here, I might agree. My own personal safety is untethered to this region.~
@10295 = ~Feh! What magical mastery can be obtained from sequestering yourself to a single tower?~
@10296 = ~Does this sparrow's ears deceive him? Why my red-cloaked sparrow-hawke, have you been hiding a starry-eyed wanderlust from me this whole time? Perhaps even a sense of comraderie?~
@10297 = ~Do not think yourself so clever bard. I have merely seen the advantage of traveling with others to further my own power (the more cannon fodder the better). I may use this group for a time and then leave as I wish!~
@10298 = ~Of course my sparrow-hawke. I'd never think otherwise (mayhaps I am beginning to rub off on him. His monologuing has only increased in intensity since we began traveling.)~
@10299 = ~Damn you bard I can hear you!~
@10300 = ~This man believes himself an island. While I think the universal importance of the balance hardly needs stating, it is clear he is not open to dialogue on the matter.~
@10301 = ~Spoken like a Thayan wizard. Tis a most disconcerting sentiment.~
@10302 = ~He is such a dunderhead isn't he? Balance this and evil that. As if smarter people didn't have more pressing matters to be concerned with. Like... universal mysteries of... unexplained problems that have plagued us for all time! Yeah!~
@10303 = ~...you may be the singularly most unpleasant creature I have ever set my eyes on.~
@10304 = ~Mages like you give the rest of us a bad name. Cutting yourself off from the people around you... it's irresponsible. What good is your knowledge if you don't...~
@10305 = ~Spare me your doe-eyed philanthropy. I have no use of it.~
@10306 = ~The world is a dismal place. If there is one thing that transcends it, it is the pursuit of knowledge. I must admit I feel no small amount of envy at your position.~
@10307 = ~Ah, at least one who understands. And an elf no less. I may need to pick your brain on something if you've a moment.~
@10308 = ~Even to the Greycloaks, the knowledge of a mythal is not well known. They are enchantments that epitomise the ancient magic of my people, yet are kept in deepest secret.~
@10309 = ~*sigh* I had thought it might be too good to be true.~
@10310 = ~Details of the ancient Mythals are here in the north? Hmm... perhaps this journey has merit afterall. The knowledge of the Mythal would augment my already considerable powers (and then perhaps I could finally leave these monkeys to roll in their mud without me)~
@10311 = ~That is for the best. The relics of my people should not be plunder for some mage.~
@10312 = ~While I need not justify myself to you, know that I do not intend ill with this knowledge.~
@10313 = ~The same of most who misuse dangerous knowledge.~
@10314 = ~Tiax is bored now by this conversation. Such magical abilities are but trifling things to his power. Why, his very sneeze has more magic in it than all of the mythals elves have ever made!~
@10315 = ~...Tiax demands to know what you are doing with that feather!~
@10316 = ~Trying to get a demonstration of your power silly! *giggles*~
@10317 = ~Ahh... bad news there my friend. It is certainly not as splendid as it used to be.~
@10318 = ~Hmm... a decent reward for our efforts though I think that for a piece like this we may have gotten a better offer from a dealer directly in Athkatla.~
@10319 = ~It would be more useful in my hands... (though I've copied the more relevant passages for myself... the day I unlock these secrets, there will be reckoning, oh yes...)~
@10320 = ~Certainly, have this priceless piece of my heritage for a trinket and some gold.~
@10321 = ~As if you'd care that your heritage was bartered away like some 5 WIcopper strumpet.~
@10322 = ~It... ahh it matters to me more than I let on Kivan.~
@10323 = ~Greetings Archdruid. It is a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance. I am Cernd of Tethyr.~
@10324 = ~A druid of the south is it? Fortunate I am then that those I was waiting for are guided by one wise in the ways of nature. Greetings to you Cernd.~
@10325 = ~A refreshing degree of humility. Even Archdruids can so often be consumed by title and ego.~
@10326 = ~Aye that is so. I'm glad we are of like mind in this.~
@10327 = ~A good thing, as I'd call no druid so sick with sympathy for "civilized folk" an archdruid. Your cohabitation with defilers of nature around this tree disgusts me.~
@10328 = ~It is fortunate then that we are tolerant of sects with... differing opinions on how the needs of nature should be met. Suffice to say, you will be tolerated here as long as you keep the peace.~
@10329 = ~Then peace you shall have for now Arundel who dwells beneath Kuldahar.~
@10330 = ~And they very nearly succeeded. Few are the times my life has been left up to fate alone, but in this instance we were lucky to escape from that pass alive.~
@10331 = ~Evil? Here? No, no it cannot be! Point to the evil things so we can smite them, dismember them, devour them! Rip the head off of the evil thing and wear it on our own like a fashionable hat ho ho ho!~
@10332 = ~Damnation! Calm yerself wizard. That's the last time I forget to slip sleeping powder in yer oats...~
@10333 = ~The most insidious evil is often the one unseen. But no matter how well it disguises itself it can still be felt, and I have also detected some force at work against us.~
@10334 = ~You are a paladin correct? I can only perceive evil from its effects on nature, but it will no doubt aid to have someone who can detect it more directly. In any case...~
@10335 = ~There is no greater indicator of a harmful presence than an upset in the natural cycle. It is sensitive to even the most subtle changes.~
@10336 = ~And the boy's father is certain he is not simply off on a flight of fancy? When I was of a boy's age I often fled home for the fantasy of a crusade through the nearby woods. Especially when father was in his cups... uh, nevermind me. We should certainly look into the boy's disappearance.~
@10337 = ~They have been vermin under our heels all the way here. Vermin we have left in puddles of gore.~
@10338 = ~I've probably killed as many goblins in the last few days as I have the whole rest of my life. Which, if I'm speaking frankly, I feel pretty good about.~
@10339 = ~And not a single goblin too many.~
@10340 = ~Patrols of giants? Oh this just gets better and better. The only thing better than slaying a man is slaying a man five times normal size. And the only thing better than that, is slaying a dozen of them. I have some payback to give them.~
@10341 = ~Aye. Shall we make a wager on it waif? Between the two of us, the one who has the most giant scalps by the end of these travels is the victor?~
@10342 = ~Call me a waif again and you'll eat my sword. And I'll take that wager. May the best woman win.~
@10343 = ~We will see about that.~
@10344 = ~If a druid cannot identify a set of tracks, that would indicate a most strange and likely unnatural creature. A foul mage's creations or something otherworldly. Either way, we must keep alert and ready for anything.~
@10345 = ~<CHARNAME>, you know I would gladly bore you to tears with a discussion of the balance if you'd but ask me. There's no need to bother Arundel with such pedantic questions. ~
@10346 = ~It is no trouble at all. Perhaps another perspective on the balance would be valuable regardless.~
@10347 = ~If that is how <CHARNAME> wishes to spend <PRO_HISHER> time, then so be it.~
@10348 = ~Dear, be n-nice. I'm sure Arundel has valuable things to s-say on the matter. You know we all v-value your thoughts on things t-too. Different perspectives are valuable as well.~
@10349 = ~*sigh* Yes, you are right. I am being unfair to everyone. Please continue.~
@10350 = ~*whispers* Nice job Khalid. I ain't ever seen Jaheira admit to being crabby so quick before.~
@10351 = ~I have my w-ways.~
@10352 = ~An abomination is what you've achieved. Coexistence is an ugly lie. You'll learn it soon enough.~
@10353 = ~As some druid sects claim. Ours is not one of them and we think that what we've built speaks for itself~
@10354 = ~It is a beautiful tale! Boo may have a lump in his throat. Or maybe this is just a hairball.~
@10355 = ~This is grave news indeed. We cannot allow such a thing to continue, certainly not while people have chosen to make their home here.~
@10356 = ~Communities that live so harmoniously with nature are a rare thing. I will gladly fight to protect it with you lady Mazzy.~
@10357 = ~Well boo hoo, sounds like ya got yourselves a real problem here that's all your own. How about you chumps put some money on the table for this service?~
@10358 = ~Oh no, I'll not be indentured to the needs o' yer pissant little town. We'll find our own way damn you and if'n we help ya, it'll be because it suited us anyway. And in such a case you best show yer gratitude with gold... or else.~
@10359 = ~Perhaps they are the cause or simply another symptom. Either way the restless dead are a good lead for whatever troubles there may be.~
@10360 = ~He has a point. When left with no other option, perhaps it is not beyond consideration to do an act that one would find otherwise deplorable.~
@10361 = ~I.. I do not think that this is the right way of things. The lesser of two evils is still an evil.~
@10362 = ~While I respect your wisdom druid, this is one matter where I stand in stark disagreement. One must not allow themselves to fall to evil, even when it seems the better of two options. If there is a choice between two evils, then I would choose to find a third path.~
@10363 = ~Auril is a cruel goddess and her priestesses much the same. Do not be wary of doing ill by her, she intends ill upon all things that be of warmth already.~
@10364 = ~I think... I think he's right. Auril would make the whole world a ball of ice if she could. Kuldahar being sapped of its warmth could be connected.~
@10365 = ~I do not think that this is the right way of things. The lesser of two evils is still an evil.~
@10366 = ~Thou wilt use scrying to thine aid? Evil so well hidden has likely prepared magical countermeasure. It will take more than a simple spell and mirror to perceive it.~
@10367 = ~My fate is determined by myself and my steel. If I receive much more of your condescension druid, my steel and I will take a more active role in determining your fate as well.~
@10368 = ~I've heard of this Gem. It reads the ley lines of the world itself, determining future and long range events through means that bypass normal protections against magical observation. It would no doubt be a boon artifact for our current predicament.~
@10369 = ~Intrepid. Hopefully he was able to find a more worthwhile use of the gem than coddling those unfit to survive within nature.~
@10370 = ~Oh are we to set out again? Could we get some cake to have on the trip? I've been craving something sweet.~
@10371 = ~Female, could you be any more oblivious?~
@10372 = ~Hey! But I...~
@10373 = ~Viconia, please do be civil. Skie tries ever so hard. Lets give her a bit of credit shall we?~
@10374 = ~*aside* She is rather blind, deaf, and dumb isn't she? Perhaps you'd like to discuss things in private...~
@10375 = ~If you say one word futher to me I will curse your manhood with the pox. That is if it isn't already too scabbed over for it to matter.~
@10376 = ~Fine, away! Bah, women will be the death of me!~
@10377 = ~We shall set out immediately and with Selune's blessing return swiftly and safely with the gem in hand. Stay well master Arundel.~
@10378 = ~A bit of burglary is more my style than wading through undead crypts anyway.~
@10379 = ~And perhaps this will give me a chance to use my tremendous brain to plan a great heist!~
@10380 = ~That sounds wonderful. Why don't you come up with your plan quietly and never share it with me. That way no one will ever find out our little secret, yes?~
@10381 = ~Brilliant! ...hey wait!~
@10382 = ~And so we set out again on yet another errand. I hope this goes better than the time my aunt Petunia joined a cult in order to learn their recipe for seasoned turnips on rice. She never was quite the same after.~
@10383 = ~A mountain journey suits me just fine. Our smaller numbers should mask our presence enough to avoid further ambushes.~
@10384 = ~I would recognize the venom if it had come from a spider. I am less familiar with the poison of serpents.~
@10385 = ~I've figured it out already. But uhh... you should say it out loud for everyone else!~
@10386 = ~What an enticing locale for a bit of adventure! I can hardly wait.~
@10387 = ~A dormant volcano huh? Gee, I sure hope someone evil and crazy hasn't set up a lair there or nuthin.~
@10388 = ~I'm startin ta suspect this berry-picker's givin us the run-around. I swear if we don't find what we be lookin for next, I'm gonna decorate me codpiece with his jawbone.~
@10389 = ~No! Hold on... we... I... oh Baervan please help me heal him.~
@10390 = ~Arundel! N-no! We have healing supplies... we c-can help you. ~
@10391 = ~What a delightful sounding fellow. I look forward to sharing tea and civilized discussion over how best to eviscerate a druid with him.~
@10392 = ~I sense the touch of negative energy is upon him. Only powerful undead or creatures of the lower planes can handle such energy. It would be best to prepare in case of either.~
@10393 = ~An Archdruid... struck down so easily. Only a powerful fiend could be capable of such.~
@10394 = ~Hmph. While I would spit on his corpse, to be felled by so perverse an abomination to nature is not fitting even for his bleeding heart. I care not for his simpering town but by nature's will we must stop whatever it is that festers in the north.~
@10395 = ~Most troubling. Whatever did this must have wielded great life draining force to be such an anathema to an Arch Druid's powers.~
@10396 = ~Ah, you mean your infantile devotion to a mere tree did not save you? (surely the rest are simply acting surprised)~
@10397 = ~Impossible. Severed Hand is a ruin. Although perhaps Larrel... he wouldn't have... would he?~
@10398 = ~Is that hope I see in your normally dour eyes?~
@10399 = ~Perhaps some small amount, though getting to Larrel himself will be an insurmountable task if he yet lives.~
@10400 = ~Ah, but it would not be the first time we surmount the insurmountable my friend.~
@10401 = ~I've heard the stories of what happened to Severed Hand. If we journey to this place, we must do so with respect for the tragedy that occurred there.~
@10402 = ~...Arundel? No... you're not...~
@10403 = ~Hey! You can't take all the credit! It was my plan too... wait a second... what plan?~
@10404 = ~What?! Tiax cannot assist lesser beings in slaying their ancient enemies before he has slain his own! This isn't how it's supposed to work! Unacceptable!!~
@10405 = ~A contradiction. We still have a few months, that gives us time to do a great many things. I will endeavor to surprise you.~
@10406 = ~A bit of the Blood War found its way to the Prime? How intriguing...~
@10407 = ~Blood war?~
@10408 = ~Tis a conflict as old as the planes and ill fit for a dove's ears. But perhaps I will explain later.~
@10409 = ~I fear we hath found our way b'twixt a war glimpsed in my most fevered dreams and carried out the will of a fiend.~
@10410 = ~We were played for fools! If only I had been more vigilent. Helm forgive me.~
@10411 = ~Blunt. I like this one. Too many o' my kind trip o'er their own hairy feet to be "well-mannered".~
@10412 = ~Ex... excuse me? Sir we are potential customers. You can't just treat us like that.~
@10413 = ~Hey don't be such a meany! Innkeepers are supposed to be friendly!~
@10414 = ~Look sunshine, why don't you put a curtain over it while you're here. I and anyone I choose to rent out rooms to appreciate the quiet.~
@10415 = ~Now that's no way to speak of a lady. Even if her voice is particularly... shrill.~
@10416 = ~I think I can hear her screaming at the bartender from here...~
@10417 = ~Left you with the claim and took off with your coin did he? Ah, an old con I'm quite familiar with. You really should be more aware of these things before looking to become a property owner.~
@10418 = ~Yeah I uhh... I really got played for a fool, didn't I?~
@10419 = ~Hah! I respect yer cunning ta get this joint but ye let down yer guard and now the chickens have come ta roost. Ye got no one ta blame but yerself.~
@10420 = ~Ha! Busted!~
@10421 = ~While I understand your reasoning, you must realize what you did was wrong. You should have had the courage to be honest to your neighbors about this.~
@10422 = ~The little man's got a point. People need inns and more importantly *I* need a bath. Sounds like he acquired it as good a way as any.~
@10423 = ~Perhaps once we get this little matter resolved I might draw your bath m'lady?~
@10424 = ~Oh dear, you can draw your own bath. I recommend packing it with snow and sitting in it until you cool off a bit.~
@10425 = ~Ugh, just kill me quickly if I ever get that blasted desire. And ta think I was starting ta respect you...~
@10426 = ~But Monty, I had such dreams for us to settle in a cottage in the hills!~
@10427 = ~I swear, every word from yer blasted mouth brings me knife hand one inch closer to yer eye...~
@10428 = ~Aww he was just looking to settle down. If he could just lose a bit of the grumpsies I bet we could be fast friends!~
@10429 = ~Oh gods kill me now...~
@10430 = ~Now that is a most equitable arrangement! ~
@10431 = ~Hey, not all thievin' is bad! I mean... we're all about the good harmless ‘no one gets hurt' thievin' here. Just cause you're breaking into something doesn't mean you're gonna steal it! Just, ya know, if it's really nice and you're really sure nobody will miss it...~
@10432 = ~*ahem* Imoen, do I need to lecture you again on the slippery slope of 'harmless thievery'?~
@10433 = ~*yawn* Only if I have trouble sleepin tonight.~
@10434 = ~Ah... a charming woman. I think my drink will sit better if she serves us in silence.~
@10435 = ~Eldoth, how surprised and mad do you think my family would get if we got married on this trip?~
@10436 = ~I... seem to be a bit queasy all of a sudden.~
@10437 = ~...excuse me ma'am?~
@10438 = ~Er, I be meaning no offense to smallfolk in general my lady.~
@10439 = ~I understand. Just be careful to watch your words. They can be like swords, and wielded carelessly can cut friend as easily as foe.~
@10440 = ~That does raise suspicions. Perhaps we should have a look about the inn for signs of foul play <CHARNAME>?~
@10441 = ~I despise small towns and their drama. Every hint of gossip I hear puts me a few moments closer to razing the whole thing.~
@10442 = ~*I* wouldn't shed any tears over this pissant town suddenly disappearing.~
@10443 = ~Ah and aren't you a beauty. Has anyone ever told you how striking your eyes are? Blue as the deepest glacier... and skin so white is quite the rarity. Perhaps you might be interested in sharing a drink with me after your service has ended for the day here?~
@10444 = ~You are... too kind sir. But I have prior engagements I must attend to after shift.~
@10445 = ~A shame. Well do keep me in mind. I've no doubt we'll be in town a while and I'd always appreciate spending some of that time with such a snow white beauty.~
@10446 = ~Yeah... sure.~
@10447 = ~Ah what an inviting destination! Full of fun activities for every little boy or girl to show and tell. We must finish our assignment on time or there will be consequences... horrifying consequences...~
@10448 = ~Bah, why'd ye have ta go and get the mad wizard excited fer somethin'?~
@10449 = ~But Monty! I want to see the spirits! You must take me there!~
@10450 = ~Fine. Maybe I can finally be rid o' ye in one o' the deeper tombs.~
@10451 = ~You two sound like an old bickery couple...~
@10452 = ~Aye, it is not right! Tiax has not given it permission to give its warmth to this town. Its warmth should only be given to Tiax! If any else deserve it, only he may decree so!~
@10453 = ~Strange fellow you have there.~
@10454 = ~Here's the lay of it barman; ye get me the biggest mug in the house an fill it ta the brim with the stoutest swill ye got. As long as I don't see the bottom of me mug, me axes stay at me side. But if'n I see the bottom o' it, me axes'r gonna come out, ‘n someone here's gonna have a bad day.~
@10455 = ~Uhh certainly sir. No need for violence here. We have ale to spare...~
@10456 = ~Good man.~
@10457 = ~Beautiful truly, but there is something about her that puts me on edge... I have a feeling there may be more to her than she seems.~
@10458 = ~A fine forge ye got here. Modest. It reminds me o' the one me father set me afore as a child. ~
@10459 = ~Your perception of your situation is indeed keen. I think even winter seems an unlikely forecast for our survival. Yet still we fight against the inevitable... *sigh*~
@10460 = ~Your boy? Could you describe him to us. We... we will keep a lookout for him. There has to be something we can do to help.~
@10461 = ~Well he's ‘bout 6 years of age... got hair like his dad, a slightly crooked nose, and... ahh there's no use.~
@10462 = ~Never lose hope. We'll find him. I know we can.~
@10463 = ~Do not direct your gaze this way. I do not prey on little boys.~
@10464 = ~I'm sorry for your loss, but you can't get so down on yourself. There's still hope. We're gonna be investigating the strange going ons in town. If anyone can figure out what happened to your son, it'll be Imoen and her merry band. <CHARNAME> might help too.~
@10465 = ~Arundel may have a big nose, but two noses are better than one, and Minsc and Boo will not stop until your boy has been found and delivered safe to you! Boo has the finest smelling of any hamster in all the world. You will see, won't he Boo?~
@10466 = ~He is wise to listen to the words of the eagle. The eagle's eyes see things from a height no person can. Wisdom comes from embracing such differing perspectives of the world.~
@10467 = ~The same has been said of uncle Scratchy's onion patch. Surely it took the black arts to create onions that succulent (and odorous) they would say. But they didn't know the half of it. We don't talk about uncle Scratchy's onion patch anymore.~
@10468 = ~We seek to challenge such notions. There tis no vale so shadowed that we will not brave it.~
@10469 = ~Well said. Helm's justice will bring light to the vale and uncover whatever hides in the shadows.~
@10470 = ~It was a small victory considering the damage done to this town so far, but a victory nonetheless. Do take care of him. A boy needs a strong father.~
@10471 = ~Anomen, you are a more gentle man than you appear at times.~
@10472 = ~Perhaps... I do concede that the plight of this boy has moved me. Though please don't tell anyone, it might hurt my stoic reputation *chuckles*~
@10473 = ~Of course. My lips are sealed sir knight.~
@10474 = ~Aw it weren't nuthin. He's a good kid. He probably woulda escaped and found his own way back even without us.~
@10475 = ~Hehe you're welcome! Now just remember to give him a big hug every day until he think he's too old to be hugged by his dad... and then you do it twice!~
@10476 = ~Little boy is safe and Minsc and Boo are heroes yet again! ~
@10477 = ~Magic o' this kind ain't me ken, but if there's one thing I be knowin it's the dwarven craft. Mayhaps this be one of a pair of items and whatever spell cast upon were meant to be for both and apart they are frazzled and dim?~
@10478 = ~I believe you are correct sir dwarf. I can feel the magic of this piece... it has a texture of longing. It wants to be together with something else.~
@10479 = ~I knew it! There's no mistaking a Fiddlebender. With their buoyant demeanor and pants pulled up unreasonably far above the waist... well mark my words, this Jansen has your number! There'll be no dealing of wyvern or any other dung I'll have you know. ~
@10480 = ~Is that a Jansen I hear? How's the turnip trade going for you?~
@10481 = ~Oh quite well, better than ever even. More reliable than gold and twice as tasty, as they say.~
@10482 = ~That's great to hear! You know, I've been working on a potion to make...~
@10483 = ~Not so fast! I know your tricks Fiddlebender. You'll not get us this time.~
@10484 = ~Whatever could you mean? You know the Fiddlebenders have always appreciated turnips-man's art. With this potions we could make your turnips grow twice th-~
@10485 = ~No thank you sir. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be standing over here nursing my grudge.~
@10486 = ~It's like I'm seeing double here.~
@10487 = ~I couldn't tell these two apart in a crowd.~
@10488 = ~Helm have mercy... one was enough but two will be the end of me.~
@10489 = ~*giggles* It's like watching mister Quayle argue into a mirror.~
@10490 = ~There is a curious harmony in their words and actions.~
@10491 = ~They're multiplying. Fantastic... *sigh* Won't someone get the exterminator?~
@10492 = ~We are nothing like each other! Oh I'm so angry I could positively steam out of the ears, which I've been known to do on occasion. It's a condition you see, one I'm quite self conscious of so I'll thank you not to mention it.~
@10493 = ~Well, that's because of a bit of shared blood between the Fiddelbenders and Jansens. It all goes waaaay back...~
@10494 = ~Hey, that's my line!~
@10495 = ~Such vessels are rare though not unheard of. Normally they require powerful magic to keep in the air. Seems this one can fly without though? I don't know...~
@10496 = ~Much can be accomplished merely through conventional use of the wonders of nature. Even in her most mundane aspects, nature is miraculous.~
@10497 = ~I suppose I never thought of it that way... still, it makes me nervous.~
@10498 = ~Tiax requires 23 WIairships by the season's end. 23 WIdo you hear?! You will not build one airship less than 23 WIor you will incur his wrath!~
@10499 = ~Airship... hmm... it could use some work. Perhaps something catchier. Like... cloud skipper! Or wind yacht! No wait, sky boat! All aboard the sky boat! Yes, I think that's a much better name than "air ship."~
@10500 = ~No you bum, marketing is all about brand name. You gotta call it something bold. Like a 'Thunderbird 5000'. Paint some red stripes on it and everyone will want a model.~
@10501 = ~Ohhh... that is good.~
@10502 = ~Natural creatures subjected to this gnome's alchemies? You cannot make a creature better than it is! If it is not fit then it is fit to die. To do anything else is to disrespect the natural cycle!~
@10503 = ~Really... No one would join you on this death-trap? I can scarce believe it.~
@10504 = ~Come now Valygar, there's no need for sarcasm. It is not becoming of you.~
@10505 = ~I... you're right. My apologies.~
@10506 = ~It is not so unlike the first time I assumed the form of a bird and learned to fly. Your first time aflight can be an overwhelming experience.~
@10507 = ~When Avariel learn to fly, we always made sure to have an adult along with to help. Flying above the clouds among the mountains is so... so breathtaking that you... that you... *sniff*~
@10508 = ~I believe I have spoken carelessly. Aerie please accept my apologies. Nature provides beauty on the ground as well as the air. Surely we will find sights to take your breath away in our journies on foot.~
@10509 = ~Ah, what it would have been like to stand on the bow of the ship and write a poem. Sadly it seems that chance has passed...~
@10510 = ~Cry me a river about it. It's ours now and you ain't gettin it except at maybe the tough luck chump markup rate. ~
@10511 = ~Sufferin' ones always be given me the creeps. Pain's somethin ain't to be shared with others, unless it's at a dagger's point.~
@10512 = ~The high cleric of the temple missing as well? Things may be more serious here than expected.~
@10513 = ~Actions like this illustrate why there are no followers of that absurd religion in the Underdark. If any had existed, they would have all died out ages ago.~
@10514 = ~What a brave woman she was then! Set off to fight the darkness on her stalwart own. May Tempus smile upon her.~
@10515 = ~A brave... if foolhardy action. While I admire the gesture, surely she could have brought a few others of the faith with her?~
@10516 = ~Cormyr? Strange. Tis a far away land. Though perhaps I am not one to speak, as mine own path hails from Rashaman by way of Baldur's Gate.~
@10517 = ~Thank you sister for treating this matter with such care. It will surely please Torm to know that we did the best we could for one of his lost servants. May he find peace in the beyond.~
@10518 = ~And so the legend can finally be put to an end! I think a ghost story was exactly the thing the tale of our travels really needed.~
@10519 = ~You'll not make the s-story too frightening w-will you? I do not care for such t-tales, even if I was the one to live them!~
@10520 = ~Maybe just a little scary to get the audience invested. But mostly bravery and valor and overcoming adversity. Maybe romance too! A little something for everyone.~
@10521 = ~Oh how I miss dear old Myrkul...~
@10522 = ~Whatever his divine status, he still reigns over this ground.~
@10523 = ~Hah! I think I will find your most precious relic and wear it as a crotch guard. What do you think of that? Try and stop me from defiling your sad little crypt!~
@10524 = ~Die, intruder!~
@10525 = ~The barmaid? Ah... a strange retreat, though the cold only seems to enhance her most stunning features.~
@10526 = ~After being pawed at by drunks all day, sitting around freezing in your small clothes probably isn't the worst thing in the world... I mean, it's still pretty close though.~
@10527 = ~Her deception is as obvious as the blinding whiteness of her skin. Do not mistake this woman for a cleric for some toothless god. It is obvious the deity she serves is less than benign.~
@10528 = ~Many are the faiths that do so. However each draws a different meaning from these trials. What do such trials mean to your faith I wonder?~
@10529 = ~Feel free to wonder as much as you like.~
@10530 = ~<CHARNAME>, you of all people should know it's rude to talk about religion in a desolate frost cave. Why, I remember last time I was in a dark cave with an old colleague of mine, Ser Jamony. Oh we'd just lost the rest of our adventuring troupe due to an unfortunate cave in caused by our party bard's poor rendition of "The Lady who was a Fish" and were trying to find our way out in near pitch black and the entire way it was "oh gods" this and "Tyr save us" that. Kid just wouldn't shut it.~
@10531 = ~Of course all that religion talk attracted a tribe of Kua-Toa who seemed as unhappy about his preaching as I was and much more interested in settling such matters on the end of a spear. Well I politely excused myself from the discussion and got on out but the debate didn't go well for Jamony I fear. Always kept religious topics to the dinner table after that.~
@10532 = ~Be not ashamed of your faith. For your god Tiax is among you! Supplicate on your knees and he may turn a favorable eye your way.~
@10533 = ~You might say such individuals would likely hide their ideology from their neighbors and choose an isolated place to worship, a cave such as this for example. If one such did exist, of course.~
@10534 = ~Really <CHARNAME>? How long do you intend to play this preposterous game?~
@10535 = ~Ugh. Finally. ~
@10536 = ~She is a cruel goddess <CHARNAME>. She would freeze the whole world and doesn't care who dies in the process. Don't trust a word she says.~
@10537 = ~When I die I hope to have all of my stuffed animals around me. Just because you're dead doesn't mean you can't enjoy fluffy animals!~
@10538 = ~I swear, all adventurers must be mad.~
@10539 = ~Great, you got her monologuing. Gee why don't you ask her about her tragic backstory now?~
@10540 = ~It's always the beautiful ones that are a bit crazy... there's no chance you could drop this and come back with me to discuss matters by a warm firelight is there?~
@10541 = ~And your goddess be a wicked creature. You are lost to the dark and only strong steel will be your atonement!~
@10542 = ~Foolish girl. Your goddess has used you. See how quickly you are discarded when my blade meets your breast.~
@10543 = ~Auril has blessed me greatly, and to stand against her will is to stand within the icy chill of death itself!~
@10544 = ~Defiler of nature! I will not rest until I have dined on your frozen heart's flesh!~
@10545 = ~Another druid! Auril will reward me greatly for destroying you.~
@10546 = ~No, not like any druid you've ever met.~
@10547 = ~We will see.~
@10548 = ~Already I can feel a great weight lift from the Vale. The spirits should rest easier now and trouble Kuldahar no longer.~
@10549 = ~A bone dance? Oh what kinda dance is that? I'm imagining lotsa shaking and rattling and heeby jeebies!~
@10550 = ~Aww... that's no fun at all. Unless you also dance a little on the side. Go ahead and do it, I won't tell your death god on you!~
@10551 = ~So strange how these antiquated tombs still carry such old notions of the gods. Ahh, I guess the same is of the living. How long did nan insist leeches would cure all her humors? Not even a vivisection would teach her otherwise... and sure enough it didn't... hehehe...~
@10552 = ~I've been trying to tell them that this whole time. But no, boys and girls must have their little dungeons to play in...~
@10553 = ~Ah the undead really are an underrepresented class among the ignorant masses. So quick to be struck down. But what can you do? Well besides raise more to send on the night raids to gather suitable test subjects for... ah I fear I've said too much...~
@10554 = ~As if we would value the opinion of such a perversion of the cycle in the first place.~
@10555 = ~The authority of Helm. There are things hidden here that must see the light to be judged in their own right.~
@10556 = ~You know, he's got a point. You're being kind of a jerk <CHARNAME>.~
@10557 = ~That is still yet to be determined. A man who gathered so many bodies to create such an undead procession can hardly be given the benefit of doubt.~
@10558 = ~Many burial rites have I presided over but none so full o' corpses as this. Whoever the man buried here, I sense a baleful spirit about ‘im.~
@10559 = ~It seems we've had an audience all this way. I hope that our performance has been equal parts inspiring and dreadful.~
@10560 = ~Watching us? Oh d-dear... I d-don't like the thought of t-that one b-bit.~
@10561 = ~Yes please! This should be a fantastic addition to our chronicle.~
@10562 = ~Normally such stories be borin' me, but this one's off ta a fine start. Perhaps I'll sit and listen a spell afore we carve this spirit up like mid-day pork.~
@10563 = ~Ahh that moment when the revelries of youth fade and the looming void of the inevitable eclipses all things. Tis a monologue I've performed often. I can scarce wait to experience the truth of it myself.~
@10564 = ~The same as any Tyrant. Turned to a coward as soon as their strength of arms fails them.~
@10565 = ~Ridiculous. You were a great conqueror and you let yourself be cowed by age and the fear of death? True power is defying even that inevitability. You were damned by feeble ambition.~
@10566 = ~And did ya spend the rest of yer years in supplication, begging forgiveness from the gods as ye shoulda?~
@10567 = ~Damn shame waste of money is what that is.~
@10568 = ~That... that's horrifying! You're a monster!~
@10569 = ~All these dead were... faithful servants you killed? Oh.. oh I think I'm going to be sick...~
@10570 = ~Hey, that was *MY* retirement plan! Oh now I need to rethink the entire thing...~
@10571 = ~A fitting ends for deeds so profane. I hope you suffer even to this day for it.~
@10572 = ~Tis what you get for worshipping a false god. Had you sacrificed yourself to Tiax, he would have allowed you to set his foot stool before his throne.~
@10573 = ~It's difficult to feel remorse for you given what you've told us.~
@10574 = ~Justice is a path to redemption, not just punishment for its own sake. I suppose even you may find forgiveness some day.~
@10575 = ~Is this the fate that awaits us when we die? To reflect upon one's life for all time? Perhaps death is even worse than I imagined it.~
@10576 = ~Do not indenture yourself to this spirit <CHARNAME>. I doubt he knows anything of worth.~
@10577 = ~Oh good, we can finally see who is behind all this and put this entire venture behind us. Of course we wouldn't have gotten here if it wasn't for me and my amazing brain!~
@10578 = ~I'll not do the bidding of some evil spirit. I follow you <CHARNAME> but know that I object.~
@10579 = ~While this spirit be of ill intent and character, Auril is a most vicious goddess. I do not object to bringing mine mace to bear against any of her foul supplicants.~
@10580 = ~Ugh! I'd rather bring my blade against your lifeless form than this priestess. I do not take well to men telling me who to kill... especially a woman.~
@10581 = ~As much as it disgusts me to deal with this fiend, he is not wrong. I suspect this Vale is simply the first step in what this priestess plans.~
@10582 = ~The evil spirit man wishes us to kill evil priestess lady. But is it evil to do something good for evil? Oh Boo, what should we do?~
@10583 = ~Reward enough for me if you spared enough on your damn crypt to keep some coin on your corpse.~
@10584 = ~Of course. His lie was obvious from the moment he suggested it. I told you to not bother with him.~
@10585 = ~A pedantic observation. Could we expect any more from this spirit?~
@10586 = ~In a certain sense he is not wrong. Though it indicates the road ahead will be long indeed.~
@10587 = ~And this is why I only make deals with the living.~
@10588 = ~At this point I don't even care anymore. I just wanna leave this hole as quick as we can. Let's get outta here <CHARNAME>.~
@10589 = ~Ain't no man livin's robbed me of my due... but then ye be dead already so maybe I'll just piss in yer tomb for the trouble.~
@10590 = ~Well this was perfectly pointless. Let's retire back to town and drink on it shall we?~
@10591 = ~Ok well then toodles mister scary spirit man! Have a great day!~
@10592 = ~Ah well, what can be done? The plunder from this crypt was at least worth the time yes? Perhaps our next venture will be blessed with more luck.~
@10593 = ~Whoa big guy! What's the rush?~
@10594 = ~Fascinating. (how do they endure such inane prattle?)~
@10595 = ~Well that's not so bad. I got called lots of things when I was younger too. "Half-breed," "pinkmane," "the mistress of miscasting," "hipster pixie," "you set me on fire how did your spell of minty freshening turn into a fireball how does that even happen oh gods," etc. Don't let it get you down. Or if you're anything like me, just find a cold treat to binge on.~
@10596 = ~I've little care to explain to this fool our purpose here. Simply dispose of him and move forward.~
@10597 = ~If you'd just stop and let us talk we could explain the situation!~
@10598 = ~You, my friend, look like you could use a snack. Think how much better you'll feel munching on a tasty turnip. Then we can just pass by you and be on our way...~
@10599 = ~Well, I tried. Looks like we found the one problem a turnip can't fix.~
@10600 = ~Guards!~
@10601 = ~Not all people fear thine wrath o' lizard king. We stand before thee so thou might answer for thy crimes.~
@10602 = ~Curious you would be surprised to see us here. You've taken so many people, you must know there would be reprisal.~
@10603 = ~Hey, Lissssspen! Ask me if I sell sea shells by the sea shore...~
@10604 = ~I do not care if you ssssell sssssea sssshhhells by the sssssea sssssshhhhore!~
@10605 = ~*snickers*~
@10606 = ~Yxunomei? A peculiar name, surely not native of the Prime.~
@10607 = ~A smart warrior brags about how many wounds he's avoided, not how many he's received.~
@10608 = ~Lizard tongue, lizard tongue, lizard tongue. I don't get it, why would that be so hard?~
@10609 = ~Lizard LANGUAGE you ssssstupid mammal.~
@10610 = ~Hey! I'm not stupid! You're stupid you dumb amphibian!~
@10611 = ~Ssfoth'a ytruk mussfath, foul thing.~
@10612 = ~Sssso one of you doesss know.~
@10613 = ~I always learn the language of the beings I intend to hunt. Not all lizardfolk have given me cause to do so in the past, but you are far beyond that point.~
@10614 = ~I'd rather be spendin' my time decoratin' a necklace o' fresh lizard tongues than speaking with ‘em.~
@10615 = ~As far as I'm concerned he has as much claim on these villagers as they have on the great tree. Survival of the fittest is the only rule of nature.~
@10616 = ~You've mislead your people King. I've parlayed with Lizardfolk before and most times we were able to find an equitable agreement that upheld the balance. Stealing from Kuldahar to feed your people is not the way.~
@10617 = ~Sssilence! Lisssspen has led hissss people to prosperity!~
@10618 = ~Until the day his actions brought the extinction of his tribe. *sigh*~
@10619 = ~Kill the outssidersss!~
@10620 = ~Sometimes they needen't even wait until then.~
@10621 = ~Yes! Boo knows best that when you are small, you strike for the eyes! ~
@10622 = ~I abhor competition. Though I have little use for a child's skeleton at the moment. Perhaps later...~
@10623 = ~You are most welcome little one! When you grow big, may the memory of Minsc and Boo inspire you to great deeds!~
@10624 = ~Please, keep the sobbing ones away from me. I'm allergic to sniveling you see.~
@10625 = ~I know that feeling too well...~
@10626 = ~Always look on the bright side!~
@10627 = ~Hmph! You'd expect these peasants to be more grateful!~
@10628 = ~*sigh* In a far better place now than any of us are.~
@10629 = ~These are sapient beings you know. Even if they tried to eat you, you can't just make boots out of them... as supple and comfortable as those boots would be... (Ugh, no Nalia, bad time to sound like your aunt...)~
@10630 = ~Yes! Boo knows best that when you are small, you strike for the eyes!~
@10631 = ~Remember that luck isn't given, it is sought out. If you wait for it, it will never find you.~
@10632 = ~Oh, big man this one. Let's put steel in his hand and let him have at it while we laugh at a distance.~
@10633 = ~It doesn't sound great. Well excepting one sunite festival I read about with some... "loose" metaphorical interpretations of ritual eating... err, at least that's what the book showed with really, really detailed pictographs and uhh... (ok Imoen, you're gettin' looks now, time ta shut'it)~
@10634 = ~No doubt his spirit sleeps easier knowing the fate he escaped.~
@10635 = ~Thou art more important to Kuldahar than thyne own credit give. The worry they feel, ‘tis well deserved.~
@10636 = ~While you carry the weight humbly, you are more important to the people of that town than just a simple cleric. Have concern for their worry for you in turn.~
@10637 = ~And like the heroes of legend we arrive in the nick of time!~
@10638 = ~A inferior sacrifice to an impotent god! Tiax would never permit so lowly a sacrifice in his name! ~
@10639 = ~Time is a capricious ally. Fortunate you are that we were able to arrive when we did.~
@10640 = ~That she chooses to stay here alone does not sit comfortably... but her bravery is admirable.~
@10641 = ~Stuff yer prayers unless they be used fer the mendin' of me wounds. We may be returnin'.~
@10642 = ~I will never understand how people can worship such terrible things.~
@10643 = ~Me clan warred against a cult ta their kind in the days of me father. A cruel pantheon they are and twas only by the strength of Clangeddin did we prevail. That and natural dwarven hardiness against all manner've ailments anyway.~
@10644 = ~Fickle and undeserving gods that grasp at true power. Even abandoned by Lloth as I was, I would never submit myself to their whims.~
@10645 = ~Talonites are good for one thing. They know how to produce a deadly poison and are quite happy to grant it for a pittance when they know you intend to use it.~
@10646 = ~A necromancer's parlor tricks and nothing more. Throw your minions at us! We will climb a mountain of your servants to destroy you if we must.~
@10647 = ~Ha! Come then warrior of light!~
@10648 = ~Too much a coward to lift thy own sword? I spit on thy dark magics. Tempus give us victory!~
@10649 = ~A priestess of Tempus here? Fine then, come and test your might against my minions!~
@10650 = ~Such a terrible, horrifying shame. Perhaps after killing her we may call on their spirit to engage in an enlightening conversation on the topic.~
@10651 = ~I'll not let that madman near me!~
@10652 = ~Ahh the leisure time to animate an army of undead minions for whatever use one might find. The younger generation simply don't know how good they have it.~
@10653 = ~And with but a few paltry spells I have rendered your months of effort as dust (like all necromancers she is all show) ~
@10654 = ~And WHY have you not yet given these minions to your lord Tiax as a gift?? You will suffer greatly for your insolence!~
@10655 = ~I have refined my techniques with each raising. The fact that you destroyed but one legion means little in the grand scheme.~
@10656 = ~I dislike the feeling of being between two intimate dancers. Especially when I know nothing of either party.~
@10657 = ~No one asked you to join it, elf.~
@10658 = ~I respect your ideals but your attempts to force nature to fit your vision is disgusting. Prepare to be fed upon.~
@10659 = ~I couldn't care less about the druidic notion of cycles.~
@10660 = ~A disappointingly myopic vision of the past. Your kind seeks to change the cycle in ways that violate the core of nature.~
@10661 = ~*gasp* Did she notice us? Oh I am beset by a feverish notion in my cheeks and a scurrying in my stomach, like spiders crawling within me. Oh I feel like a little boy again. May we bind her soul to a dark hued gem after we have hacked her to bits? Pleeeeeaaaase.~
@10662 = ~You'll not get the chance!~
@10663 = ~If you truly believe that she will keep her bargain, send me forth. I would relish the opportunity to lay this witch low.~
@10664 = ~Yes, come then righteous one and let us face one another directly.~
@10665 = ~I volunteer to go forth in thy stead. Tempus shalt be mine shield.~
@10666 = ~Then approach, silly priest. Let us end this.~
@10667 = ~We must accept this challenge. Let me go forth and by the strength of Helm I will prevail.~
@10668 = ~Oh, I would so love a chance to bring this self-righteous fool to his knees.~
@10669 = ~How peculiar. His body is colder than it should be. ~
@10670 = ~Oh thank goodness a friendly face. No, I think... I think we are alright.~
@10671 = ~Something feelst strange about this one. Be wary <CHARNAME>, things are not as they appear.~
@10672 = ~Tis strange to find s-such a peaceful f-f-faith in so remote and dangerous a l-location. I w-would welcome the reprieve though.~
@10673 = ~The clothes of a priest but the face of a con-artist. This is a familiar racket. Do watch that you do not let yourself be taken advantage of here.~
@10674 = ~Unbelievable! Non-violence has never protected anyone from a sword to their belly. The lizard-people would have no doubt seen this enclave as easy pickings unless there was some other threat here.~
@10675 = ~Fine by me. Only honest way t' live. An a head a day keeps the misery at bay heh.~
@10676 = ~A wonder it is that they haven't already then. If they are as weak as they claim, then opportunity for us to take as we will <CHARNAME>.~
@10677 = ~I respect your commitment to non-violence, however I am greatly interested in how exactly you applied such tactics to survive. ~
@10678 = ~And with a simple slip of the tongue, his facade fades. Press him on the matter as you will <CHARNAME>, but I will begin chanting the incantation for my next spell forthwith.~
@10679 = ~It's no use to remain ignorant of this any longer. This is clearly a trap intended to ensnare would be intruders.~
@10680 = ~Snakes!? Aww, why'd it have to be snakes?~
@10681 = ~The time of the monkey has ended! The time of the snake arises!~
@10682 = ~That means that's where they hide the good stuff. Either powerful magic tomes or dirty literature. Either way, we gotta check it out.~
@10683 = ~Wait wait! We're not who you think we are. Not in the face!~
@10684 = ~C-calm yourself friend. We mean you no harm. P-please relax and let us explain.~
@10685 = ~Oh I love the enthusiasm. Why not let them have the front lines <CHARNAME>, and we can follow in their wake and pick up the pieces?~
@10686 = ~The battle is joined. But keep your voice down before we lose the element of surprise entirely.~
@10687 = ~As the possum, you feigned death until the opportunity for escape was provided. There is no shame in emulating even the most humble of nature's creatures when it allows you to escape or fight at a better opportunity.~
@10688 = ~Fitting that a male would suggest such cowardly tactics. Unfit to lead any band worth leading. Stay away from me. The smell from your stained trousers offends me.~
@10689 = ~Jeez lady, lay off a bit.~
@10690 = ~*hurk* Don't... don't throw up... don't throw up...~
@10691 = ~I'd prefer to eat in private. Feeding like this seems so impersonal.~
@10692 = ~By Avoreen... these horrors cannot continue.~
@10693 = ~By the Seldarine, these monsters must not be allowed to live a moment longer.~
@10694 = ~Is that a fork I spy to the right of the knife? Everyone knows that the knife goes right of the fork, not the other way! Such a breach of etiquette must not stand.~
@10695 = ~Ha! In my daydreams hide more nightmares then you have ever known. Prepare yourself for true horror at the edge of my dark blade.~
@10696 = ~All of the primates shall fall!~
@10697 = ~What did they do to these people? This is horrible. We must free them from this curse.~
@10698 = ~Thy actions were not thine own. It may be small comfort, but take heart in that if any is to be taken.~
@10699 = ~Little girl! You must flee behind us. Minsc will protect you!~
@10700 = ~Uhh... I know exactly what you're talking about! Don't even try to confuse us with tree references... right?~
@10701 = ~Be careful. This is some projection or illusion.~
@10702 = ~Past, present, and future for me. Kind of old news really.~
@10703 = ~It is too late for that. The pull of fate is inexorable and we are already swimming within those rough tides.~
@10704 = ~Oh this is way too creepy. You know, I bet there's plenty of other adventures we could be having. I wouldn't vote against it.... in case anyone else was also considering it...~
@10705 = ~Some plants must be burned for the safety of the forest. We do not shy from the flame.~
@10706 = ~I like the yappin o' this twerp th' less ‘n less I hear it. ~
@10707 = ~Foul tidings be these... I like them not.~
@10708 = ~Such delightful poetry, the musings of a creature from the great beyond! Ah, and is that the scent of the Abyss I detect? ~
@10709 = ~Keep thy dark visions to thyself. We need them not.~
@10710 = ~It's not my way to kill little girls but the more she speaks, the more I'm reconsidering that.~
@10711 = ~Whatever ya be calling ‘em, not sure we've left many ‘o them for your "kingdom" heh.~
@10712 = ~It does if there's a good story to be written about it. Oh I just can't deal with suspense!~
@10713 = ~You... you can't just disregard people like that! Or people like us will stop you.~
@10714 = ~Gettin' a bit tired of bein' told I can't understand what's goin' on when no one will stop and explain it.~
@10715 = ~She's right, you know. That *was* a stupid statement. I would prefer if you not make us look like fools before this... being.~
@10716 = ~Oh yeah? Well Tiax was around even before then! Time only exists because he says it is so! And... those things about tides and blood are nothing but... but... Tiax rules all! You will see!~
@10717 = ~As long as you're not full of yourself or anything...~
@10718 = ~Ah, I know of only one war that could be described as such. It makes this sparrow a touch homesick... ~
@10719 = ~That sounds almost as serious as the Garlic War of 1342. ~
@10720 = ~Some people do. My own dreams hath illuminated such worlds. Tis unpleasant but such is my burden to carry them and pass on what wisdom can be gained from them to my sisters.~
@10721 = ~And protecting my witch is the most important of tasks!~
@10722 = ~Beautifully spoken! A universal truth that hardly need stating. However, perhaps my dear Tanar'ri, you might speak such with more joy and less... condescension.~
@10723 = ~You'll find that the guise of a child will do little to stay my blade.~
@10724 = ~Had you as much power as you claim, I may have beseeched your service for some part of it. But you hold nothing of value for me. Back to the abyss with you.~
@10725 = ~Then you will have to settle for a gift of death~
@10726 = ~Guardian, we come here with noble purpose and in deepest respect, right <CHARNAME>?~
@10727 = ~It would be wise to pay respect here, sincere or not. Such guardians are unyielding in their purpose which only grows more rigid with time.~
@10728 = ~Many a tale has been spun of those noble warriors. Oh wouldn't it be neat to get a demonstration of their skills? Maybe not from this fellow though...~
@10729 = ~Not an elf alive hasn't aspired to become a Bladesinger. Ah, but it turns out that life isn't for all. The dedication required is quite severe. ~
@10730 = ~Diplomacy and magic, these are good, but your swords are so tiny! How can you strike fear in the heart of evildoers when you hold metal sticks?~
@10731 = ~Bah! A foolish waste (perhaps some secrets lay amidst the ashes still... I must investigate further).~
@10732 = ~A grim sacrifice to make, but one that would have been necessary given the hopelessness of the situation. The power of those artifacts could never fall into orcish hands.~
@10733 = ~A side-effect of the magic that was unleashed from one or many of the artifacts maybe? With so many different sources, it would be difficult to say. ~
@10734 = ~Thou would have better to have fought to the last than resort to magics. Thy glorious stand was robbed by your mages.~
@10735 = ~You gave everything but s-s-still protect this place? Even if from a c-c-curse, you still honor your people. I h-hope you can be freed f-from it soon.~
@10736 = ~For such a trial to only be awarded with this? Something very wrong happened here.~
@10737 = ~Ooo! Shinies!~
@10738 = ~Whatever you're selling we don't want it. Lousey ghost elf speaks like a carriage salesman.~
@10739 = ~I don't see a ru... wait, is there a ghost rug there? Oh man, I really wanna see the ghost rug!~
@10740 = ~Tiax demands the invisible rug! All will suffer until he treads upon it!~
@10741 = ~He is time lost and does not perceive the passing of ages. Tis unlikely we willst be able to clear the mist from his eyes.~
@10742 = ~I can't imagine what it'd be like to be stuck in this ruin forever. I guess clinging to the memory of the past back when things were good is the only thing you have.~
@10743 = ~Do not be foolish. These lies are damning them.~
@10744 = ~But Jaheira, he's trapped already. Lies are all he's got now. Without those... well he'd be just as miserable at rest of the spirits here.~
@10745 = ~The illusion of happiness is no substitute for the real thing. He's made a second cage, and now have twice as many to free themselves from.~
@10746 = ~I just don't know...~
@10747 = ~Uhh... that's... no, that's really not true.~
@10748 = ~I don't think this man has ever been south of his own nose. ~
@10749 = ~Greetings Telanis. It is refreshing to see that even as a haunt of these halls, your lust for life has not faded. ~
@10750 = ~Oh fantastic! Imagine what stories and songs he'd have to tell!~
@10751 = ~Oh, do spare us. He is like a dog waiting to show his master a new trick.~
@10752 = ~Not even the cold tug of oblivion seems to have diminished this one. Aha! Fair enough my hound, please continue.~
@10753 = ~Oh but madness is quite relative. In this place of decay, here you are in unlife as if nothing has changed at all. Who is really mad?~
@10754 = ~So it was Larrel's spell that caused this then. I can hardly be surprised that such spellcraft perverted the very fortress it was intended to protect.~
@10755 = ~Oh no, I've fallen in love! Forgive me <CHARNAME>, I'm going to stay here with my beloved ghost elf for-ev-er!~
@10756 = ~Ok ok, not really yeesh, don't give me that look.~
@10757 = ~No, it cannot be so! My people and elvenfolk have had rocky times, aye, but no dwarf worth his granite would give a weapon to an orc. It's unthinkable!~
@10758 = ~Heh, maybe the orcs wised up and gave them a better offer. Elves shoulda been more wary of the competition if you ask me.~
@10759 = ~For even our young to be stuck in this... state. Oh by the Selderine we must do everything in our power to fix this.~
@10760 = ~It's nice to... to meet you Sehriya. I am Aerie. I think... *sniff* yes I think it would be great if we could play sometime.~
@10761 = ~The poor girl... Hi Sehriya. Would you like to see a trick? Watch my hands and... look, a scarf! (kids always love that one)~
@10762 = ~*giggle* No way! How'd you do that?!~
@10763 = ~Oh it's a secret. But if your mom tells me you've been good, I'll know I can trust you to keep it ok?~
@10764 = ~Ok!~
@10765 = ~I'm sure she will. If I see her I'll let you know you're waiting ok? *sniff*~
@10766 = ~You must not feel sad little Aerie. We will help here. You will see.~
@10767 = ~Oh I hope so Minsc. I hope so...~
@10768 = ~Don't you worry Sehriya. I'm the smartest guy you've ever met so you just stay there and I'll go find your mom for you.~
@10769 = ~Aww you're a nice guy afterall! I'm never gonna let you forget it hehe.~
@10770 = ~This is... an unexpected degree of charity from you.~
@10771 = ~Since when did you decide to stop being an insufferable ass?~
@10772 = ~I just... I hate to see children in situations like this. They don't deserve it. Unlike adults, they at least might one day grow up to be smart and...  oh forget it!~
@10773 = ~There's no sense in trying to explain the situation to this forsaken child. We should leave quickly... she unnerves me.~
@10774 = ~Yet another tale of magic used to fix a problem only to create one far greater.~
@10775 = ~A mage's magic is a coward's tool. If more strong arms were what was needed, thou should have done more to bring them to thy cause.~
@10776 = ~A truly potent spell. A shame the knowledge of it was held by one insufficient in spellcraft. (elven claims of superiority in the arts overblown as always)~
@10777 = ~Only the most senior elven archmages are taught such spells. It must be for that very reason that knowledge is so restricted. No mortal hand should wield such power.~
@10778 = ~A curious reaction! Oh how I would have loved to be there and observe the effects. Perhaps we can get this Larrel to do it again? Who would like to volunteer as a subject?~
@10779 = ~It must be a miserable existence even beyond life itself to be stuck between it and death. Destroying these shadows would be a mercy to them now.~
@10780 = ~It is a travesty to see a place of worship reduced to such a state. We should find this holy water and do what we can. The elf gods deserve better.~
@10781 = ~Maybe the elves were more enlightened than I give them credit for, having such a strong female in charge of their military forces.~
@10782 = ~The elves have always awarded position based on merit, not sex.~
@10783 = ~Then you are halfway to being a respectable people.~
@10784 = ~It is a cruel th-thing that those who died in this attack were the l-l-lucky ones. I cannot imagine the h-horror of this new unlife.~
@10785 = ~A Baelnorn? Very few elven mages ever achieve such a state. It's considered a great sacrifice to our people. Life never ending as a lich... even blessed by the Seldarine as Baelnorn are, I would never wish it even on my enemies.~
@10786 = ~The process of casting the mythal must have accidentally transformed him to a lich. (how frustrating that fate should gift inept fools with such powers!)~
@10787 = ~I woulds't most like to gaze upon this astrolabe. In it we may understand how to beseech Larrel for aid as well as for mine own curiosity.~
@10788 = ~I've heard of Prime mages using such devices to glimpse into the Planes. Like the props of a play suspended over the stage, our audience can glimpse the terror and wonder of things beyond their ken with imagination as their guide!~
@10789 = ~Any soldier would wish the same. Her request would bring them small bit of glory at least.~
@10790 = ~Feh! If she should wish death on the remnants of her army so much, we should begin with her.~
@10791 = ~Finally, a woman of real mettle! Die on your feet as you should!~
@10792 = ~Strike me down as you would a man!~
@10793 = ~May you find peace in the lands beyond. ~
@10794 = ~And you as well. Thank you.~
@10795 = ~Nature will never return when you try to confine it to such an enclosed space. You'd do better to throw down the walls and leave this place exposed to the true face of nature. Only then it may find beauty again.~
@10796 = ~Ha! A true coward in words and deed. He would have been better off dying with an axe in his back.~
@10797 = ~Not all are fit for war, it's true. It's not cowardice to attend to home during wartime but... I can't help but wonder if you might have tried anyway in such a dire situation.~
@10798 = ~<CHARNAME>, we... we should do whatever we can to help. This place can be beautiful again, I know it can. It's worth trying at least, right?~
@10799 = ~Oh, are we gatherin' seeds ‘n berries fer an elf ghost now so they can make themselves a little meadow ta frolick in? Pfeh.~
@10800 = ~It would be a long way to go to procure these items. While I admire this elf's intentions, I wonder if our time might be better spent elsewhere.~
@10801 = ~We can do this <CHARNAME>. I don't mind taking the extra time. It would mean so much if just a little beauty could be brought back to this forgotten place.~
@10802 = ~Well I gotta hand it to ya, for all the work we put into it, this don't look half bad. So how about a picnic?~
@10803 = ~We are fortunate that this elf is addled. This should let us peruse what works we like without intrusion (and take whatever is of worth).~
@10804 = ~It's truly impressive that this library should be as well preserved as it is. If you do not mind, I would like to look through the stacks before this knowledge fades away forever.~
@10805 = ~This book holds no special value. It is curious that someone would come all this way for it.~
@10806 = ~That's a long way to go for a book. Especially one as... dull sounding as that.~
@10807 = ~Strange... it seems we are not the first to enter the Hand since its fall. But why would this elf woman have come all this way just for a book on unicorns?~
@10808 = ~Don't say that! I bet with just a bit of elbow grease, you'll get it running just like new!~
@10809 = ~Well ain't he a pleasant fellow.~
@10810 = ~Hmm yes yes, it's pretty good. But I think you could have done better if this spigot was moved over to this doohickey so it turned that doodad there and then that gizmo would be free to power the flux capacitor. ~
@10811 = ~You've got a fine device here, but it really could use the Jansen touch. No Astrolabe would be complete without Jansen brand astrolabe oil. With this your orbs will spin and rotate without a squeak. You know, they say that the squeaky wheel gets the grease, but I say the squeaky wheel needs to just shut up and get with the program. Anyways, why don't we get this astrolabe back together and then we can talk business.~
@10812 = ~This guy sounds like my cousin Jambi the morning after a turnip-wine bender.~
@10813 = ~Finally, you are restored to coherence Larrel. I am Xan, a Greycloak of Evereska. Your knowledge may be all that can save this region in these desperate hours.~
@10814 = ~Tis good to find allies in the face of such p-perils. ~
@10815 = ~Such alliances can be the basis of great things... if they are not formed on unstable ground.~
@10816 = ~The best of both our people's crafts forged together? What fine works those would be.~
@10817 = ~A potent combination but our people's arts should be more than just for war.~
@10818 = ~Such weapons would have been a great benefit to the northern people. Did you not consider the others threatened by the hordes as well?~
@10819 = ~*mumbles* Fools you were to think gold isn't worth more than an elf's gratitude.~
@10820 = ~Most distressing. In the absence of any other reason, what options did you have?~
@10821 = ~This cannot be! A dwarf's word is worth more than all the gold he's ever mined. There must have been a misunderstanding.~
@10822 = ~No alliance can exist with so much distrust. More should have been done to investigate this.~
@10823 = ~You stand by a decision that damned your people forever? Mages are ever quick to justify their reliance on magic...~
@10824 = ~Such a cause would be hopeless without invoking the most powerful magic. What choice did you have?~
@10825 = ~Ah the doomed last stand, tis a crowd pleaser in any play and a more fitting metaphor for the condition of life I cannot imagine.~
@10826 = ~They did their people proud... but to have so many lives cut so short...~
@10827 = ~The separation b'twixt life and death is a thread's length. A spell that draweth from one can be so quickly fall to the other.~
@10828 = ~And I thought my spells could go bad...~
@10829 = ~Really? Visited by a god... just like in the stories? Truth is sometimes stranger than fiction.~
@10830 = ~Glad I'll be to die never having drawn the eyes of Labelas Enoreth. He and I don't much agree on what makes a good life. ~
@10831 = ~We must always remember that the eyes of the gods are ever upon us. ~
@10832 = ~I've never heard of the Baelnorn condition inflicted on someone as a curse... this is a punishment I cannot fathom being justified...~
@10833 = ~Harsh, but perhaps the world would be a better place if the gods took a more active role in moderating the use of such magics.~
@10834 = ~His heart be poisoned by his pain... I know the good dwarves of Dorn's Deep be not responsible for his loss, there's no talkin' to him on it now.~
@10835 = ~I understand the fury that comes with losing a loved one, but this cannot be the way. For the sake of his soul, we must find out the truth of the matter.~
@10836 = ~His bitterness... t-tis clouded his eyes to any other truth. I h-hope we can find some way t-to bring him peace~
@10837 = ~I wish you safe passage when it should come Larrel. May your trials be both lesson and inspiration for our people.~
@10838 = ~Do say hello to Hanali Celanil for me when you get to Arvandor if you could. It cannot hurt to have my name dropped to the goddess of love before my arrival.~
@10839 = ~Glad I am to have this matter put ta' rest. Dwarf and Elf should not mistrust each other such when cooperation serves the both.~
@10840 = ~Is there something I can do to speed your journey?~
@10841 = ~Elf, human, dwarf, or even halfling, ye don't live long trustin' anyone. Ain't plannin' to start now.~
@10842 = ~Please, if we are to continue on this journey, let's take the nice skeleton on his offer shall we? My feet will be very thankful for it.~
@10843 = ~The accusations Larrel made of me people sicken me t' the core. We should take whatever route gets us to Dorn's Deep fastest ta settle this feelin' in me gut.~
@10844 = ~A dwarven stronghold would be a rich location for exotic valuables. If we are fortunate, some ill will have befallen it to allow us to take we will without complication.~
@10845 = ~I'm sorry, I wasn't paying attention... my coat has this tear in it... where are we going now?~
@10846 = ~If you insist on heading that way, allow me to cast a spell to save you the days of travel through the frost.~
@10847 = ~I do love the efficiency of communication here.~
@10848 = ~Huh?~
@10849 = ~A lone mage, all by himself where no one will find him... and with magical treasure ta boot. Now there's an opportunity if I ever saw one.~
@10850 = ~I like the look of this mage little. I will be on my guard....~
@10851 = ~You don't really like the look of any mage.~
@10852 = ~That may be true but even so this one seems especially dangerous.~
@10853 = ~Peace friend, we mean you no harm, and none shall learn of your sanctuary from us. If you would spare but only a moment.~
@10854 = ~Don't be such a grump! Let's play a game! I spy with my little eye... something that begins with the letter...~
@10855 = ~M, Mage. You're looking right at me.~
@10856 = ~Oh you got it!~
@10857 = ~How about this game? I'm thinking of an object... it's not bigger than a breadbox...~
@10858 = ~It's a breadbox. You're thinking of a breadbox.~
@10859 = ~Jeezies, you're good.~
@10860 = ~Oh yes, I'm sure your research is just sooo important...~
@10861 = ~Let him demonstrate them then. I will educate him on true power.~
@10862 = ~Perhaps a more tactful approach would be appropriate here. While I doubt we would have much difficulty with him, he may have useful information still.~
@10863 = ~Weave your spells mage. I hope you prepared a contingency of numbing to save you from a painful death.~
@10864 = ~Isn't noone who should be down there then priests ta' tend to the ancestors.~
@10865 = ~Razorvine, truly? Tis unusual for it to be found anywhere but the lower planes. And Sigil of course.~
@10866 = ~But I want to know about the Razorvine! Tell me! Oh c'mon...~
@10867 = ~It may not grow, but it's not for lack of trying. Why, a dear old friend of mine by the name Mansev once got his hands on a batch of razorvine seeds from a tiefling who told him he could crush it into a spicy pepper. Mansev was a horticulturist of unparalleled skill and we used to say he could grow a turnip patch on the back of a troll if he had to. But he never met a plant so ornery as Razorvine.~
@10868 = ~He planted those seeds in every consistency of dirt imaginable, dirt that would grow a patch of vegetables powerful enough to conquer a small nation. Well nothing was working at all and finally he decides to just import dirt straight the Abyss, which is cheaper than you'd think if you know the right Tanar'ri. It poisoned all of his other crops, but wouldn't you know it, the Razorvine starts growing faster than you could imagine! It covered his entire field in the span of a night.~
@10869 = ~Why Mansev was so happy he jumped for joy, dancing around his new Razorvine patch. Sadly Mansev was never the most graceful man and he danced with such verve that he lost his step and tumbled right into the briar. He died in horrible pain, cut to ribbons. I'm told the razorvine grew quite well for a long time afterwards. But also turns out Razorvine can't be made into pepper, so it was all for nothing anyway. Oh well, I guess it's just like they say, the reward of a thing well done, is to die by it.~
@10870 = ~Are you still talking?~
@10871 = ~Oh sure, they're knocking down the door. Had to beat all those adventurers off with sticks to run your dumb errand first. Yup yup.~
@10872 = ~Ok how about this one. A riddle! What's in my pock...~
@10873 = ~You have a ring in your pocket. Now leave.~
@10874 = ~Whew, this guy is just too good.~
@10875 = ~Gee that table sure looked INTERESTING didn't it? Didn't it look INTERESTING? Maybe you should look at it a little harder to see how INTERESTING it is?~
@10876 = ~(the fool probably did not even think to look at the table...)~
@10877 = ~Gah! Minsc will not yield to this challenge! He will strike the puzzle down with berserker fury until it is solved!~
@10878 = ~Tiax commanded the contraption to move, yet still it was! Why does it defy Tiax so!?~
@10879 = ~I'd certainly rather be dead than a giant disgusting bug. (shudders) But then I'd just be smaller bits of bug now wouldn't I? Let's change this topic.~
@10880 = ~He gives them better brains to hate with and this is how they repay him? The world is truly unfair.~
@10881 = ~A lead! We should track down the whereabouts of this girl, and in doin' so clear the name of the Dwarves who lived here.~
@10882 = ~Then we are getting close. We must find what happened to her. I think... I think maybe it might help us lift the curse left on Larrel. ~
@10883 = ~What can we say? We're just special like that.~
@10884 = ~Well... I thought it was impressive...~
@10885 = ~Gods help me, if I ever end up as cranky as him, my Torm strike me where I stand.~
@10886 = ~Ew! Is that bug thing talking to us? Keep it away...~
@10887 = ~Hm... never have I known an Umber Hulk to speak. Perhaps it would be wise to hold our blades for now.~
@10888 = ~A poor fate for a Wizard of Thay, but one which he has no doubt caused upon himself.~
@10889 = ~These are great crimes, yet I sense your petinance is quite great as well. I hope that you find your way.~
@10890 = ~A fate well deserved for your evils. Let us leave this loathsome thing to its fate.~
@10891 = ~I've killed fer all kinds of men, but never a bug-man. Not that I be mind'n, blood is blood after all.~
@10892 = ~None back home will hear of this. It is better you be forgotten.~
@10893 = ~Yes... yes that is... best.~
@10894 = ~Bye bye bug guy! Maybe after chewing on some rocks he'll be a little bit happier?~
@10895 = ~Why bother engaging this monster in conversation? Just kill him, take the badge, and be done with it.~
@10896 = ~What do you whisper about over there?~
@10897 = ~<CHARNAME>, I do admire your commitment to at least attempting a diplomatic resolution.~
@10898 = ~Die!~
@10899 = ~When opportunity knocks, one must answer (hehe).~
@10900 = ~A necromancer weavin' their black arts ‘mongst our honored dead? Nay, say it isn't so...~
@10901 = ~A glimpse into oblivion from your very home hmm? T'would be a grand sight, though best viewed at a distance. The negative energy plane is most unkind to the living.~
@10902 = ~Whilst portals to the elemental planes are not so uncommon, one to the energy planes is most rare and they shouldst be treated with utmost caution.~
@10903 = ~This could have been avoided with further vigilance... where one undead springs, others may follow as a plague until the source has been eliminated.~
@10904 = ~Mine ears hear the battle drums sounding through the ages, even to this day. They echo through mine heart.~
@10905 = ~A blessing from Moradin! Glad I am to hear that our people's faith remained strong in those dark hours.~
@10906 = ~Buncha rubbish. More interested in seeing that weapon he had...~
@10907 = ~The outcome of that would be disastrous. If the cycle is a spinning plate, such vortices would be the tiny imperfections in the plate that could cause it to topple over.~
@10908 = ~I doubt this wizard has the power and skill to actually achieve this end... but we should stop him regardless before he causes even more damage. ~
@10909 = ~It's fortunate that some villains prefer to keep their weaknesses close to them. This gives us a target to strike at.~
@10910 = ~What an amatuer! Every would-be-lich knows you put your phylactery either at the bottom of the deepest underdark ocean, or you fire protect that baby and throw it into an active volcano. ~
@10911 = ~If only it wasn't just the dead who had gained such retrospective.~
@10912 = ~A clever ploy, and more the fool both of yer kind were for fallin' for it.~
@10913 = ~Finally, clarity and vindication. I can breathe easier knowin' it weren't our kind ta' blame for all this.~
@10914 = ~The injustices to both our people must be repaid. Know this; I will ensure it is so.~
@10915 = ~Hail to ye Norlinor. Yeslick, priest of Clangeddin I be. It does me heart ill to see such a great forge cold and ill-used.~
@10916 = ~Well that's whatcha get for payin' lip service to the gods. Like a savvy businessman, once they get your business, they'll never let ya go.~
@10917 = ~A fouler intention than I even imagined. A stop must be put to this necromancer at once, ‘fore this sacred place is defiled further.~
@10918 = ~Unacceptable! All the dead should serve Tiax, as the living do! Oh Tiax will smite all of them!~
@10919 = ~And upon ye as well. May ye be warmed by hearth and forge in the lands of our ancestors.~
@10920 = ~You as well, honored cleric of Clangeddin~
@10921 = ~A lich? That complicates matters. They can be tenacious adversaries.~
@10922 = ~How depressing to see someone brute force what should be a graceful transformation! Such wasted potential...~
@10923 = ~Then we are afforded an opportunity. Let us plan our strategy to take advantage of this fact.~
@10924 = ~I d-do not like the thought of venturing near that d-d-dark portal, but it s-seems we have no ch-choice. ~
@10925 = ~And so your alliance fell. I can't help but wonder if there had been more communication, you might have stood with one another in these times of crisis.~
@10926 = ~My people, in their long lives, can sometimes let their old prejudices bias their judgments. If only they had listened better instead of following their assumptions...~
@10927 = ~And I care little to be disturbing. Let's be on our way, ‘lest we be seekin' to leave another body in the snow.~
@10928 = ~I like the thought little of leaving a priestess of Auril to her plotting. We should search her intentions.~
@10929 = ~I care little for this one's tone. I doubt she means us well.~
@10930 = ~Another pale beauty! Greetings m'lady, tis a strange place to find one so alluring.~
@10931 = ~Dark portents... be on your guard <CHARNAME>, this one wishes us harm.~
@10932 = ~An' what of it? Ye come to see the swing o' me axe or be ye curious what yer innards be lookin like on the ice?~
@10933 = ~*sigh* And of course, once again, a beautiful woman more interested in killing me than engaging in other, more pleasurable pursuits. I must have offended Tymora greatly for her to curse me with this foul run of luck.~
@10934 = ~Die you fool!~
@10935 = ~That low fence in a circle? What kind of slave pen is that? You'd be lucky if your slaves weren't escaping accidentally on their way to be whipped!~
@10936 = ~Oh I don't much like the sound of that...~
@10937 = ~Guarding an easily escapable pen of slaves? You know that this must be the strongest and smartest giant to be given this post.~
@10938 = ~Really? You see me, a striking and breathtaking young woman, and the first thing you think is I'm a giant croney? Has your brain become frostbitten or am I just having a really bad hair day?~
@10939 = ~Have you ever heard the phrase, ‘don't look a gift griffon in the mouth'? Well it's a true statement and I'll stand by that to the day I die. Just ask aunt Petunia why she wears an eyepatch. Well you probably shouldn't since she would likely answer through a combination of shrieks and spitting, but my point stands.~
@10940 = ~Look, a slave who knows how to subtract. You've missed your calling as an accountant. Perhaps you should manage the giant's finances.~
@10941 = ~How rude! I mean, both the sacrificing and also the gloating. Really unnecessary.~
@10942 = ~Aww, don't mention it. Get outta here before you catch a fever.~
@10943 = ~Heh, as you say miss.~
@10944 = ~There is no need to explain. May your passage be safe and perhaps we will see you again.~
@10945 = ~Blessings upon you in your travels.~
@10946 = ~Just imagine how scary it was when it was alive... That thing would have been huge! I wonder if there's a story about how it fell.~
@10947 = ~In every tale there is a truth my beaten hound, even the most fantastic of them. Perhaps this experience has expanded your imagination if naught else.~
@10948 = ~Huh... I suppose I never really think ‘bout normal folk that don't fight monsters and creep through dungeons all the time. I guess all this stuff seems pretty unbelievable if you aren't always exposed to it like we are.~
@10949 = ~Ignore those worthless fables! The only tale you need know is the one of Tiax and how he ascends to absolute power! It is a tale of the ages and for all ages... full of extreme violence and adult situations.~
@10950 = ~The giants that ambushed us in the pass. It's payback time!~
@10951 = ~Mewled like a posturing child. Press him on this and he will surely give up his badge. Or simply kill him, it will no doubt be easier.~
@10952 = ~Touchy. Seems like someone's got an inferiority thing going on...~
@10953 = ~A man ten times normal size is still less than nothing to me. ~
@10954 = ~*sigh* Oh no, whatever will we do.~
@10955 = ~Nice bit of deception there <CHARNAME>. Let's get out of here and let no one be the wiser, shall we?~
@10956 = ~Good that you were able to get the b-badge, but I do n-not like the thought of them continuing their raids.~
@10957 = ~Agreed. Leaving these giants to their raiding will trouble this area for generations to come. It may be prudent for us to find a more permanent solution.~
@10958 = ~Well that's hardly sporting. Also exactly what I would have done...~
@10959 = ~Hath he no honor? He offends Tempus by resorting to such low tactics.~
@10960 = ~Strange to find a wyrm developed enough to speak yet still so small. Perhaps a descendent of the bones that decorate this cave. ~
@10961 = ~A fact most "civilized" people are quick to forget... until one of nature's creatures has its teeth around their throat.~
@10962 = ~For such a creature of elemental composition to know fear of a ‘master' they must be quite deadly. ~
@10963 = ~Huh, never seen something from the plane of ice shiver quite like that.~
@10964 = ~Of course he'd like us to kill the escaped slaves. But what does he offer that we couldn't simply take for ourselves?~
@10965 = ~A simple job if ye will it. An escaped slave will be quick ta trust. T'will be an easy task to sink a blade in his back while it's turned.~
@10966 = ~Marketh!? What is that pretender doing here!?~
@10967 = ~Given the danger at hand, your initiative is commendable.~
@10968 = ~Just trying to do what I can.~
@10969 = ~Helping poor people is exactly the kind of activity that will get you into trouble. Though undoubtedly you know this, given your current predicament.~
@10970 = ~It admittedly hasn't gone so well as I wished it to.~
@10971 = ~See? All thieves ain't bad. I'll have to bring this up next time <CHARNAME> gets all piffledy on me for checkin' out <PRO_HISHER> pack when <PRO_HESHE> ain't lookin.~
@10972 = ~You must be cunning indeed to have made it so far. Ah but not all challenges can be conquered simply by hiding can they?~
@10973 = ~Ye got talent. Ye'd better ta have made off when ya had the chance...~
@10974 = ~Given her situation, I can scarcely blame her for being reticent. Perhaps by helping the other slaves we can earn her trust?~
@10975 = ~It is not wise to withhold information from us.~
@10976 = ~A fascinating custom! Hmm what would my last name be... perhaps something like talespinner? Garrick Talespinner! Yes, that has a nice ring to it.~
@10977 = ~Dugmaren always was an odd fellow, as are his priests.~
@10978 = ~I didn't know the dwarves had a god like that. *giggles* I bet he and Baervan would get along really well.~
@10979 = ~And for all the wrong reasons. What use is there in exploring the world if you ain't making a profit from it?~
@10980 = ~Was that before or after he somehow brought a whole giant whale into the place?~
@10981 = ~I've known dwarves who thought it was quite mad to wash your hands before eating, even after a whole day spent in the mines or at the forge, so take that as you will.~
@10982 = ~Tis an impressive structure, but I can understand why some among the dwarf folk would find it rather peculiar. They prefer simple, practical designs.~
@10983 = ~It's really quite impressive. I know nobles who'd pay a small fortune to view the animals here... well if they were unfrozen anyway.~
@10984 = ~It's wonderful. I wish Baldur's Gate had a zoo. I never get to see any interesting animals.~
@10985 = ~And so he created an unsightly blight upon the land filled with cages. Better if the dwarves stayed underground and did not disturb nature so.~
@10986 = ~Tis but a small reflection of the Museum that will be built in Tiax's name. In Tiax's museum, there will be astral kraken and demon princes in chains and on display. None but Tiax shall be permitted to view them, unless they please him greatly.~
@10987 = ~You know, I never imagined when I joined with you that we'd be building bridges together <CHARNAME>. Oh sure, metaphorical bridges of mutual trust and respect to span the chasms of envy and bad hygiene. But not like, actual bridges.~
@10988 = ~I'm sure the court tried very hard to never bring it up in the King's presence. Ah, to be an onlooker then would have been quite the treat.~
@10989 = ~I've been at a few parties with a uhh... unique relative of a noble with some condition. Everyone tries so hard to not acknowledge them that they become even more awkward doing it. Sort of amusing for a while though usually it makes me feel bad for the... uhh... person being avoided. It's just a cruelty of another kind really.~
@10990 = ~These people look malnourished and exhausted. If we had come even a scant few days later, it may have been too late.~
@10991 = ~I find myself shocked to see when those in captivity find strength to fight against their situation. The willpower required to ignore how hopeless things are... or perhaps it is simply ignorance.~
@10992 = ~How interesting! I'd much like to take a look at this machine. I've been looking for something to help warm my toes when I am uhh... shunned... away from the campfire.~
@10993 = ~That must be it. I had been wondering how they kept the bodies of water warm enough to support the creatures in them. What a strange world that such things can be done without the aid of magic...~
@10994 = ~The door in your grasp, but the key, missing! Tis a most maddening sensation for a thing to be so close yet so out of reach. Will the final act end in tragedy or triumph?~
@10995 = ~More people saved by Minsc and Boo and friends! If heroism could be eaten, we would grow fat as hamsters!~
@10996 = ~It's good we've been able to find, and assist, so many captured people. Hmm... I admit to feeling rather parched. But I will resist the temptation for now.~
@10997 = ~But it is a dwarven hold! Even if ye be kindred in intention, these be not your lands to protect.~
@10998 = ~Great... bloody spirit paladin be in our way. As if a livin' paladin wasn't aggravatin' enough...~
@10999 = ~While this paladin's faith is true, I sense something has perverted his sense of duty. Inquire further and maybe we can find what it is that has actually bound him here.~
@11000 = ~It is not pride to stand firm in your convictions even when all the world stands against you. You were true to yourself despite overwhelming odds against you.~
@11001 = ~It is not enough. I must continue to serve.~
@11002 = ~*sigh* This man's spirit was tortured by his inability to stop events he had no control over and some... thing has taken advantage of that fact and enslaved it. I know better than any that the duty of a Paladin of Torm is unwavering... I doubt any words we have to say will dissuade him.~
@11003 = ~However noble he was in life, he now lacks all sense of right and wrong. Gah! How can we fight what is wrong when what is wrong cannot be perceived as such?~
@11004 = ~Rest now noble paladin. Your watch has ended. May you ever be an example of a man who stood firm by his convictions in the rushing of the tide and did not waver even after your body fell.~
@11005 = ~We should take the trek to fulfill his request. He deserves the honors of a proper burial at least for all he stood for in life and after.~
@11006 = ~Do we have to go all the way back to Kuldahar? It's such a long trip to lay a pile of bones and armor under some dirt...~
@11007 = ~Why gnome slaves? This hardly seem like a capable labor force (I suppose you use what materials you have available...)~
@11008 = ~First Salamanders of Frost, and now Salamanders of Fire. It seems this Dorn's Deep has a strong affinity for th' elements.~
@11009 = ~You give an inch and you're liable to be taken for an entire league. Next they will no doubt be asking us to massage their dirty feet for them.~
@11010 = ~Hmm... while it would be irresponsible not to offer our aid to protect them from this danger, it would be best if this community could learn to sustain themselves for the long run. Adventurers will not be around to save them forever.~
@11011 = ~Stuff yer curses. Ungrateful bastards.~
@11012 = ~Count yourself lucky if we leave without taking your lives. You should bless us for the extra days we've given you... that is if we decide to leave without further violence.~
@11013 = ~Salamanders are a lesser race of small consequence, barely fit to be conjured to serve as fodder. Forgive me if I forget to bow to you, "king".~
@11014 = ~You dare?!~
@11015 = ~Sometimes even the most beautiful rose's thorns can be sharp enough to give me pause. I think I should go... elsewhere... for the duration of this conversation.~
@11016 = ~Oh ho, now this is a female with some backbone. Ask her to join our warband, and throw out one of the useless men who accompany us.~
@11017 = ~I might mistake this one for my kin if my eyes were closed.~
@11018 = ~This really isn't the time to bond over the difficulties of being a woman in charge.~
@11019 = ~So what are you even doing here?~
@11020 = ~A row boat full of giants? What kind of songs do you think fire giants would sing? They must have some kind of giant shanties to bellow! Yo hooo!~
@11021 = ~Hmm... it would be an effective strategy if carried out perfectly. I do not believe they would foresee such an attack, but the chance to capitalize on it would be short. If given a chance to recover, the retaliation would surely be more than a few giants could handle.~
@11022 = ~Buried under lava would be a better fate than the dark elves deserve.~
@11023 = ~Oh that would never wor... actually come to think of it, it really might.~
@11024 = ~Hmm... virgin blood is always the sweetest.... oh do not mind me, just thinking aloud.~
@11025 = ~I suppose every man in the world should be grateful. Not that she is bad on the eyes but that glare could turn a man impotent.~
@11026 = ~Finish your discussion with this vile woman shortly. My arrows will not remain in my quiver much longer.~
@11027 = ~We should not carry on this conversation much longer. Every word this woman speaks is bile and I cannot stand it much longer.~
@11028 = ~Not a bad motto if I do say so myself, though a bit on the nose as it were.~
@11029 = ~Hold your ignorant tongue! Tiax is incorruptible! All things he says are true, for it is he who decides what is true!~
@11030 = ~The sheep who follow that absurd god are a particular ripe bunch of simpletons.~
@11031 = ~I don't know what made you the way you are... and I don't care! I just know that we have to stop you.~
@11032 = ~I like you, it's just too bad I have to kill you. Now don't disappoint me.~
@11033 = ~I will give you only death!~
@11034 = ~Come to think of it, I *was* running low on loose teeth. If you'd be a dear and had over some of yours, I'd be very appreciative (hehe).~
@11035 = ~Charming folks the svirfneblin are. Never met one who didn't think the best way to get yourself out of a hole was to keep digging down. The Jansens have a very distant relation who is a svirfneblin. Very... very distant. We don't invite that branch of the family to get-togethers.~
@11036 = ~Such is living really. All triumphs simply form a greater precipice from which to fall from. The cruel jest of the Gods.~
@11037 = ~Really sir, we mean you no harm. We would like to help you if we could.~
@11038 = ~Clever. I will have to remember that should I range beneath the surface.~
@11039 = ~We could certainly use a base of operations closer to here. Kuldahar is a long ways to go back for a safe haven.~
@11040 = ~Is it too much to hope they have warm beds without any sort of underground flea or tick infesting them?~
@11041 = ~Tis a modest hamlet, but I t-think we should find it s-safe enough to rest for our next outing.~
@11042 = ~Ye don't suppose they got ale here do ye? I swear, I'll rip this place apart brick by brick te find some.~
@11043 = ~A respite, however brief, is appreciated. We may want to look into other visitors as well for supplies. Such camps are always frequented by those looking to offer exotic goods to those in desperate need.~
@11044 = ~I am honored to be a guest in your house Beorn. Is it ok for me to speak a prayer to Baervan Windwanderer while we rest here?~
@11045 = ~Certainly! Never have I seen an elf to worship a gnomish god. How'd you come to such faith?~
@11046 = ~I was... saved by a kind gnome by the name of Quayle. He nursed me to health and taught me about Baervan and how you didn't need to be physically strong to overcome adversity if you had cunning to out-think them or kindness so that you always have friends to help you. Since then, Baervan has always been there when I needed him.~
@11047 = ~An inspiring story. I would have liked to know this Quayle. Perhaps we could pray with one another.~
@11048 = ~Yes, I'd like that!~
@11049 = ~If you don't mind me saying Beorn, this temple's a bit on the shabby side.~
@11050 = ~To tell the truth, I do mind. Uhh... so do you hold the faith?~
@11051 = ~Of Callarduran? Oh Bytopia no. I mean, what kind of idiot would worship that pebble eater? No, no, I worship Baravar, a truly smart god for geniuses like myself.~
@11052 = ~Ah yes, well if you do decide to pray, perhaps you could do so quietly toward the back of the temple...~
@11053 = ~(...what a jerk.)~
@11054 = ~Where is your temple to Tiax?!~
@11055 = ~Ah, excuse me? Who is this uhh... Tiax? I've never heard of him.~
@11056 = ~Who is Tiax? WHO IS TIAX?! He stands before you now! Tiax is the lord of all you survey! He commands the sun and moon to rise! He could undo all of creation with a snap of his fingers. All will worship him when he ascends to power!~
@11057 = ~Ah, I see. Well perhaps you could worship yourself quietly toward the back of the temple...~
@11058 = ~Until the next person with a firm hand comes and enslaves you at least.~
@11059 = ~They are fools to think that generations will live unaccosted by my kin. You've bought them a few years at best before a new master finds them.~
@11060 = ~Lor dkinosse'vel'klar, jaluk! Usstan xun naut kyon ulu telanth xuil dos.~
@11061 = ~Evagna uns'aa, jabbress.~
@11062 = ~A similar attitude was held in Trademeet. When two parties are mostly concerned with commercial matters, they tend to look less closely at who they are dealing with. For good and ill.~
@11063 = ~Trademeet, you say? Perhaps I will venture there to offer wares, if the surfaces would make allowances for my skin.~
@11064 = ~Wow... I hope that one day I can travel that far! It sounds so exotic.~
@11065 = ~Perhaps one day you might accompany me then? You are a lovely thing and would make for fine company on the road.~
@11066 = ~Oh that might be nice...~
@11067 = ~Uhh excuse me, but hands off. (that's my meal ticket)~
@11068 = ~Consider my offer.~
@11069 = ~Ye mean that ye were the reason fer all of this? Yer stinkin' theft murdered thousands! How can ye justify it?!~
@11070 = ~If all it takes is one merchant to bring an end to a people, then they weren't that strong to begin with. It was not I who made the dwarves and darthiir mistrust each other so.~
@11071 = ~Bah! Leave me sight now. I never want ta see yer smug face again.~
@11072 = ~Now that's a savvy play. And while all sides fought, you was laughing all the way to the bank heh heh.~
@11073 = ~Say the word <CHARNAME> and I will strike him down where he stands. His crimes are many, and I am not in a forgiving mood.~
@11074 = ~And thus with one card removed, this trader brought down both houses. One must admire his cunning, even if the results were rather... well, messy.~
@11075 = ~The blocks were set to fall before I got there. If it was not I who tipped them over, someone else would have in time.~
@11076 = ~He's expecting you to bargain. You'd be an idiot to take it at that price.~
@11077 = ~He's upsellin' you with the dagger. Unless you really want a stinkin' dagger, don't fall for it.~
@11078 = ~What's he doing with his tong... oh eww, that's disgusting.~

@11084 = ~Maybe standards are different for under-people? I probably shouldn't judge...~
@11085 = ~Look how adorable his attempts to seduce you are. Oh isn't it just *precious*?~
@11086 = ~I mean... that's definitely something to be happy about...~
@11087 = ~I know the type. A strong blade wielded boldly usually sets them to running. At least we have numbers and know exactly what we deal with.~
@11088 = ~Hearing Ilmater's message perverted in such a way still sickens me. To see such a selfless dogma dragged through the mud...~
@11089 = ~I know Ilmater's priests to be strange sorts, but never have I heard their faith expressed in such vile manner. An imposter this master must be.~
@11090 = ~This Poquelin sounds like a man with a taste for the flamboyant. Sometimes the easiest way to hide is not away from sight but rather in the shadow of something larger than life.~
@11091 = ~Red stains around feet of robes... and red wraps over wrists... and could you repeat that last part? I'm trying to write this all down for when I compose the epic tale of our journey.~
@11092 = ~MALAVON! You wretched sorry excuse for a wizard! What's this I hear about you settling with an army of mere Umber Hulks? I thought you were a man of ambition! Don't think I've forgotten about the time you switched in a non-poisonous spider into my ritual circle! They mocked me for days and I told you then that there'd be a day of reckoning. Then I heard you had died and I cursed the gods for robbing me of the chance to get back at you. Behold your great rival BAELOTH! Your day of reckoning HAS ARRIVED!~
@11093 = ~I'm sorry, who are you?~
@11094 = ~You don't even recognize me? WH-WHAT?! I... Indignities upon indignities!~
@11095 = ~Oh noooo, not the wittle itty bitty gnomes. Won't someone please think of their tiny children?! Ah, but so long as we preserve their skulls, it'll be something for the little tykes to play with. Hehe hahahaha!~
@11096 = ~Uhh... ok then...~
@11097 = ~We are at the whims of a madman, his mind fragmented. Speak with care, we will only get one chance at this.~
@11098 = ~Every word could be your last! You'll want it to be a good one!~
@11099 = ~Keep him talking. Perhaps in his madness he will leave an opening for us to strike without undue harm befalling the prisoners.~
@11100 = ~This drow has succumbed to madness, yet I sense something odd about him. He is disconnected somehow.~
@11101 = ~It's less than she deserves. If you knew the things she's done, you would say so too.~
@11102 = ~You mean I gave that whole speech and it wasn't even the real Malavon?! Oh I hate him more than I can describe! But at least I have found the real Malavon. Malavon you bastard! Know that I, Baeloth, will have your head!~
@11103 = ~Do I know you?~
@11104 = ~AHHHH! My head could just EXPLODE right now.~
@11105 = ~That can be arranged!~
@11106 = ~Well, at least the simulacrum was a good one. The authentic Malavon's just as nutters as the copy.~
@11107 = ~You really like hearing yourself talk don't you? I mean, really really really like it.~
@11108 = ~Aye, it'd bring any grown dwarf ta tears it does.~
@11109 = ~Oh, I should see if we can get a svirfneblin sculptor back at the manor when we get back to Baldur's Gate. The statuary at the estate is so lacking.~
@11110 = ~S-such humble nobility. We will d-do everything in our p-p-power to free you friend. You and your s-son deserve your lives b-back.~
@11111 = ~Very good. Never let them take that from you. You will not need to worry about Marketh for long.~
@11112 = ~Loyalty born of sincerity, but it does not change the fact of what this Marketh has done. It is a great shame that we must fight.~
@11113 = ~Minsc understands that this man has helped you, but he is an evil man! You must turn around or else you stand with evil and thus against Minsc and Boo!~
@11114 = ~Nothin' personal ya understand.~
@11115 = ~Awwwwkward...~
@11116 = ~Aha well done my Raven! If only we could convince all ne'er do wells to pursue a career in the arts rather than die in our wake. The world, nay the multiverse itself, would be a much better place.~
@11117 = ~Watch out art world, here I come!~
@11118 = ~Knock em dead out there! Uh, but with your paintbrush and not your sword cause then you'd just be doing what you were already doing here.~
@11119 = ~Never have a seen a female of my kind so... cowed. It's really quite pathetic.~
@11120 = ~It seems this Marketh is quite good at training his bitches. And a drow bitch no less. That may deserve some congratulations.~
@11121 = ~Darling, you must have just a teensy bit more self-respect than that.~
@11122 = ~Oh by Shar, I can't even look at this anymore.~
@11123 = ~This is unacceptable. She may be of dark heritage but abuse is abuse and I will not stand for it.~
@11124 = ~This Malavon must value you greatly to hath invested such magic into thy containment. Or more likely I fear tis your suffering he values.~
@11125 = ~An impressive series of contingencies (though why he would bother on such a worthless specimen is beyond me)~
@11126 = ~We should kill her "man" and force her to look at his corpse until she realizes that all men are just meat for the slaughter. She'll thank us for it later.~
@11127 = ~*sigh* It is as I feared. She has been in captivity so long her head has been fooled into loving him. I once rescued another girl in such a condition. She had been kidnapped by a vile blackguard but she claimed to love him when we came to her rescue. It was a great malady of the heart that knew no sense.~
@11128 = ~Listen, <CHARNAME>, while I usually would not support killing even the vilest villains without a proper trial, we cannot allow this Marketh to simply go free because of this girl's misguided hopes. She is not of right mind. She may hate us for doing the right thing in the moment, but it is irresponsible to allow this man's actions to go unanswered because of her feelings.~
@11129 = ~Hmm... I do not trust her claims. Whatever her intentions, the dark taint of her kind holds sway on her soul.~
@11130 = ~I didn't think much about the suffering of others... until I suffered myself either. I hope you can find someone out there that understands you.~
@11131 = ~Never did I think I could see a truly repentant drow and yet here she stands before us. We should always remember that even in the darkest depths that virtue can spring given proper ground to feed it.~
@11132 = ~But Paladin, I stand here beside you. Do I not spend enough time on my knees to your liking? Shall I flagellate myself in penitance or did you wish to deliver my punishment yourself?~
@11133 = ~Silence Viconia. Your redemption is likely beyond any mortal means. Be lucky I haven't sent you to the gods to seek it as of yet.~
@11134 = ~I look forward to the day you try, oh so righteous one.~
@11135 = ~Some people make their own prisons <CHARNAME> and there is little that can be done to help them.~
@11136 = ~Before you go, a word. This place may haunt you for a long time yet. Just remember that you are greater than the suffering you have endured. You must go forward with the strength to leave it behind.~
@11137 = ~I... I will. Thank you.~
@11138 = ~We should kill her "man" and force her to look at his corpse until she has realizes that all men are just meat for the slaughter. She'll thank us for it later.~
@11139 = ~Listen, <CHARNAME>, while I am not quick to advocate murder, we cannot allow this Marketh to simply go free because of this girl's misguided hopes. She is not of right mind. She may hate us for doing the right thing in the moment, but she will be grateful with time. ~
@11140 = ~Oh let's ask if he has any sweets! I sure could go for a strawberry pie, yum yum!~
@11141 = ~Wherever do you pick such things up my friend? Hah, wherever you did, it's a good thing you remember such trivia, as we may now proceed without them any the wiser.~
@11142 = ~Yes, kinsman all around here. Pay no mind, we'll step so softly that none will know we be here...~
@11143 = ~Aww thanks buddy! I guess he wasn't such a bad guy afterall!~
@11144 = ~And just so we're clear, 'funny' meaning that you do anything to piss the boss off.~
@11145 = ~Anyone else getting instant creep vibes off this guy?~
@11146 = ~An opportunist. I know his kind well enough. He will get the job done but is a coward of no real ambition, content to simply take what comes within his grasp. I would not trust him with taking away the chamber pot.~
@11147 = ~Evil hidden behind the veil of pragmatism. This man has no conscience!~
@11148 = ~I've known nobles like you. You think if you can reduce those beneath you to a product that can be spent and discarded, you can justify the atrocities you've committed. You don't factor the lives of people, just the labor you bleed from them. Disgusting.~
@11149 = ~Yes well, I hardly need to justify my actions to you now do I?~
@11150 = ~Conductin' a successful business is rarely without its costs, I'll grant ya that. Long as yer turnin' a profit though, that's what matters.~
@11151 = ~Those were me people ye cad! Ye can't just take a man's hard work and sell it as yer own! It ain't right!~
@11152 = ~I umm... I don't know if I'll be able to include this part in the story. I worry it would really upset the audience.~
@11153 = ~I don't much care for the look your wench there is giving me.~
@11154 = ~I'm just imagining how your body will look in about two minutes when I've split it down the center from crotch to neck.~
@11155 = ~Devils below, take your hysteria elsewhere.~
@11156 = ~You speak true to a point. Moral weakness and survival beneath the surface are incompatible concepts. Still, you're a disgusting male and were I more compelled I think I might show you true unpleasantness...~
@11157 = ~You seem like a guy who doesn't need a whole lotta wrongs to justify a right. Like, not even two of ‘em.~
@11158 = ~Regardless of what this woman may have done in the past, you act basely and I'll not stand idle and suffer it to continue.~
@11159 = ~All cycles are based in repetition. By seeking revenge for one mistreatment, you simply create another that continues onward. You should put more thought into your actions.~
@11160 = ~Yes, in comparison to the art of suffering that a skilled priestess of Lolth can create, his beatings are barely clumsy finger paintings on a cave wall.~
@11161 = ~That sounds like a very rigorous interview process. Uncle Scratchy used to say that all customers were vipers and so to work at his vegetable stand you would have to jump over a pit of venomous snakes he'd dug out in the back. That didn't go so well, as you'd expect when you have employees who were great long-jumpers but couldn't sell a turnip to save their lives. It didn't help that people started asking questions about where young gnomes with aspirations of vegetable selling went missing.~
@11162 = ~This betrayal is not something that we can allow go unanswered. This man stands in violation of everything that is just.~
@11163 = ~Ye saw an opportunity and ye took it. I'd certainly do the same, though this party hasn't shown itself ta be weak enough ta discard... yet.~
@11164 = ~Just a thief? Not also a slaver, a murderer, a liar, and abusive to women. I implore you <CHARNAME> to not let him slither away. His crimes must be answered for.~
@11165 = ~So quick to scurry under a rock as soon as the situation falls out of his favor. Even if he troubles us no longer, whose lives will he destroy a year or a dozen down the road?~
@11166 = ~You can just have it, really. You'll never see my face again and I'll trouble you no longer.~
@11167 = ~That is right! Boo has outsmarted you today. Never underestimate his hamster cunning!~
@11168 = ~I understand we gave our word, but can we really let this scoundrel go? Ugh, I will need to trust that justice will find its way to him another day...~
@11169 = ~Darling, you've been beaten. Just give it all up and be grateful we leave you your life.~
@11170 = ~Blasted woman! You won't even let a man keep his pride, will you?~
@11171 = ~Ecstasy at your hands? Darling, that's my line. It just sounds... well, weird and creepy coming from you.~
@11172 = ~A priest must represent his god and emulate them in all ways. If you are acting in direct opposition to them, then you are heretic of the highest order.~
@11173 = ~You know, sometimes I wonder about overly religious folk. Sounds like they got lots of pent up uh... needs.~
@11174 = ~Tis not enough that you pervert your god's teachings, you defile his dead as well? This cannot stand.~
@11175 = ~Faith without reason is mindless zealotry. In your thoughtlessness, you cannot possibly understand the will of your god.~
@11176 = ~There is an evil that clings to his mind like a black fog. We must find the source of his confusion. There will be no talking sense into him in this state.~
@11177 = ~<CHARNAME>, while his thoughts are his own, they are being altered by some enchanting force, perverting them against his true will. Whatever is doing this to him cannot be far.~
@11178 = ~Please my brother, do not allow yourself to take the blame for what has transpired here. Your mind was held by some evil enchantment. You cannot be to blame for what was forced upon you.~
@11179 = ~Be that as it may, I still am the locus for so much suffering... you must understand that I have to repent somehow. It is the way of my faith.~
@11180 = ~ Aye, I do know that well, and respect your wishes. Peace be on you.~
@11181 = ~Tis like a dream, one that progresses as it wilt while thou is incapable of thy own action but aware of all that transpires. Tis an incomparable horror to be lost in such a thing..~
@11182 = ~Aye well, Berronar be forgivin' enough if ye repent with sincerity. It's not like these be yer own actions, but rather the actions of a far darker will.~
@11183 = ~Do you feel that? The evil... it positively radiates from him? I can see nothing beyond his black aura.~
@11184 = ~His black aura is overwhelming to my senses. Such a feeling could only originate from a being of the hells themselves.~
@11185 = ~I prefer the game of Death. I wonder how well you will play it.~
@11186 = ~D-don't thank us overmuch. You'll b-be joining her soon enough f-fiend.~
@11187 = ~Considerin' that we stand before ye now, I'd say ye got a bigger obstacle to be worryin' yerself about.~
@11188 = ~To a fiend, hate is akin to love and is enough to cross the planes themselves. Tis a romance under any other name.~
@11189 = ~Truly? Hmm... (perhaps I will be able to seize opportunity from this venture yet...)~
@11190 = ~Ugh! I can sense the unnatural presence of it as we stand. A foul thing that nature revulses from.~
@11191 = ~So you're saying that I have you to thank for giving my sword so much practice over the last weeks?~
@11192 = ~Tiax is unimpressed by this Crenshiskibob! Tiax's powers are beyond comprehension and..? Hey what are you doing!? Do not ignore Tiax! Tiax demands your attention!~
@11193 = ~That's what I've been trying to tell them... yet still we continue, as futile as it may be.~
@11194 = ~Easthaven? No! We must... we must do something! It cannot be too late!~
@11195 = ~Of course this goober would side with the unspeakable evil thing. Not even gonna pretend to be surprised.~
@11196 = ~Oh, all hail the mighty ruler of a meaningless pissant town. But you'll forgive me if I do not bow for you.~
@11197 = ~Nothing is beyond imagination! Or... at least I hope so. Or else this story is going to have a very unsatisfying ending for the reader.~
@11198 = ~A fiend of the lower planes? Tis not so ineffable a concept, though they certainly enjoy to pretend as such.~
@11199 = ~As schemes go, it's not a bad one at that. Ah, provided the heroes don't return to save the day that is.~
@11200 = ~No one in a cage has any reason to be grateful for the person who put them there. You are a greedy man, however you justify it to yourself!~
@11201 = ~It was the crystal's will that made that decision? He has less control than he pretends.~
@11202 = ~From one con man to another; my fellow, you've been had.~
@11203 = ~As if we haven't already been speaking to literal demigods...~
@11204 = ~Souls are a poor crop even in the best of seasons, I can tell you. Why my... oh, is now not a good time?~
@11205 = ~Well that's bad. Uhh... anyone got a plan?~
@11206 = ~Your attempts to confuse our moral sense even in your desperate hour are in vain fiend. None of us question what is to come next.~
@11207 = ~Well <CHARNAME>, you sure know where ta find a good adventure. You know me, with you till the end.~
@11208 = ~I shouldn't be fighting some kind of devil lord! I don't even know why I'm still here!~
@11209 = ~Ah hells, what did I let ye talk me into? If we live through this, my blade and you may need ta be havin' a talk.~
@11210 = ~With the portal closed, now's our chance. He's obviously some type of Baatezu. Utilize any proofs against fire you have and uhh... hit it until it stops moving?~
@11211 = ~If I am pulled into the past to engage in another battle for the fate of the world before the end of my days, it will be too soon. Let's avoid such things in the future, shall we?~
@11212 = ~I'm going to try and unload everything I've got on him! Uhh... here's hoping I don't blow us all up!~
@11213 = ~By the Seldarine, may I strike true.~
@11214 = ~You've caused so much pain... so much suffering. No, it's up to us to put a stop to it. Now!~
@11215 = ~Remember this face. It is the face of the man who will send you back to hell, devil.~
@11216 = ~We really need to live through this everyone, ok? I've got a best selling tale in the works and it's not going to be able to sell much if we all die before I can write it.~
@11217 = ~What color do you bleed, bastard? Actually don't say, it'll ruin the surprise.~
@11218 = ~No shelter will be given to your kind! May nature swallow you whole and spit you out where you belong!~
@11219 = ~Boo does not like you! Minsc does not like you either! Feel the fury of my berserker strength! RAGHHHH!~
@11220 = ~An army from the hells, descending upon the realms? Tis a delight to consider but no, no my work must continue unabated by such reveries. There will be no disruptions, damn you!~
@11221 = ~Well this adventure certainly did go places! Let's finish this up quickly, and afterwards return to our time for a drink and regale a few gorgeous maidens with our exploits. ~
@11222 = ~Ye've desecrated the home o' me kin and angered the gods! Me hammer falls down upon ye!~
@11223 = ~All this talk ain't worth a gibberling's fart. Let's kill this thing and get to counting the loot.~
@11224 = ~You are not allowed to call upon an army from hell! That is Tiax's army! You will be punished severely for attempting to usurp his rule!~
@11225 = ~A creature of the lower planes does not belong in this world. Begone, and take your corruption with you.~
@11226 = ~I would prefer it if the surface was not infested with creatures of the lower planes when I escape from my kin. Nightsinger, provide me your blessing. Let me cast this creature back to the hole it crawled from!~
@11227 = ~Onward! We push this fiend back to the hell it crawled from. For Helm!~
@11228 = ~Thou corrupter of souls, begone and never return to this world again!~
@11229 = ~I think I might be in a bit over my head. Oh dear...~
@11230 = ~T-this will be a tough one. Give it everything you've g-got!~
@11231 = ~I tire of witnessing your feeble flailings. Today you witness the arcane supremacy of Edwin Odesseiron!~
@11232 = ~If you can't learn to be nice then we'll have to put you on time out for a couple thousand years.~
@11233 = ~How much am I getting paid for this? Oh nevermind, we can discuss it after. Whatever share I'm getting isn't enough.~
@11234 = ~A faint glimmer of hope... will it be enough to triumph despite all odds being against us? I have my doubts but I will do what I can.~
@11235 = ~Ha! Now this be a tale for the ages! Give my regards to whichever Baatezu Lord you serve when you see them.~
@11236 = ~Show no hesitation. We have one chance. Strike with the wrath of Nature!~
@11237 = ~This has been an interesting venture <CHARNAME>, and quite profitable. Please do not die now. I would dislike our partnership to end here.~
@11238 = ~Uhh... go get him everyone! My brain will assist from uhh... the back lines where it won't be in danger!~
@11239 = ~Pfeh, Dorn Il-Khan is manipulated by no man or devil. Pray for mercy to your masters, they will be kinder than I!~
@11240 = ~Strike true friends! Cover the sides and watch for the injured. We can win this day!~
@11241 = ~I have prepared myself for this. Can you say the same fiend? Let us see how your resolve compares to our own.~
@11242 = ~Well are we fightin' now finally or what? ~
@11243 = ~You have only deceived yourself if you think you can stand against us. Your schemes end this day!~
@11244 = ~Finally! A battle that willst be sung by skalds unto the ages! Tempus, give us victory!~
@11245 = ~I can't wait to tell stories about all this. Of course, no one will believe me when I tell them, just like all of the true stories I have to tell. *sigh* Such is the curse of being a Jansen.~
@11246 = ~By Torm, I will avenge all those you have wronged! Fall, fiend!~
@11247 = ~What an adventure we've gone on my friend! For what it is worth, I'm glad to have seen this one through to the end... ~
@11248 = ~Finally, a fight to test our power!~
@11249 = ~Well that takes the cake. "You are the hero of my dreams" has to be the cheesiest come on line I've ever heard.~
@11250 = ~We should listen to this shaman. Dreams can be leaden with prophecy and t'would be wise to heed them. Within reason of course.~
@11251 = ~I have heard that the peoples of far north call Tempus by the name Tempos. The name he is given matters not to I, but if thou speakest true, I am most eager to hear thy revelations!~
@11252 = ~Ooo! Do you promise? Mother will get quite cross if you're lying... hehehe.~
@11253 = ~Well, we've already delayed your destiny this long. Why not continue to blunder around the north? Our father's legacy will simply work itself out.~
@11254 = ~Helm teaches us that diplomacy can be as effective a weapon as the sword. We should investigate this as soon as we are able.~
@11255 = ~I sense a truth to this man's words. It would be wise to look into matters ourselves and determine if this threat is real and a danger to the balance.~
@11256 = ~This war cannot be allowed to occur! Not unless Tiax has properly ensured that they kill in his name of course.~
@11257 = ~Nature does not return the dead to their bodies. Unless he has returned as a bear or a stag, then his return is a most unnatural occurrence.~
@11258 = ~Some people have all the luck.~
@11259 = ~And your once great warrior is now paraded around like a sack of meat by something greater. How ashamed you must feel.~
@11260 = ~Jerrod? But it cannot be so. To return now is to undo all meaning his sacrifice had!~
@11261 = ~If ye ask me, it isn't no concern of ours. Unless he's got an offer for us, just more trouble I got no interest in.~
@11262 = ~Aha! Then birds we will be! Let us swoop and soar to our destination!~
@11263 = ~Wait wait wait! I get translocation sick really easy. Just a quick cantrip to protect from nausea and I'll be ready.~
@11264 = ~Yes, I'd prefer not dying if that is an option!~
@11265 = ~We're not ghosts! We're flesh and blood and cake and candy and all that good stuff!~
@11266 = ~Oh, ya know, we just happened to be in the area and was missin' ya terribly so we thought we'd pay ya a visit.~
@11267 = ~N-never count us out. When we s-set our mind to something, we're really q-quite d-d-determined.~
@11268 = ~I have little patience for self-flagellation. We come here for you. If you wish to feel bad for yourself, do it on your own time.~
@11269 = ~Aye, but it be a wise man who questions the judgement of a dishonest king. A king's law's only's as good as his word.~
@11270 = ~This material desecration couldn't be by chance. I would guess doing so was needed as a ritual component to cleanse the body of its spirit and make way for whatever controls it now.~
@11271 = ~Thy visions bear the signs of being meddled with. Tis telling in its own way.~
@11272 = ~The gods ever do love irony don't they?~
@11273 = ~Gloomfrost huh? What a friendly name. I guess "Sad Glacier" was taken?~
@11274 = ~And we're heading there at this time of the year? Gosh, you guys I don't know, sounds like it could be lousy with tourists.~
@11275 = ~What an evocative legend! For what light can there be without darkness? The greatest fire casts the longest shadow.~
@11276 = ~Ye got a funny way of sayin' that we got ta kill everythin' on the way up there, but I'll not be mindin the exercise.~
@11277 = ~Ah she is a spritely one is she not?~
@11278 = ~A truly tragic story, though this sparrow suspects it is simply just that. She has talent, given proper training, I suspect the stage would welcome her gladly.~
@11279 = ~What's wrong girl, do ye fear the dark? Well let me tell ya this... ye should be. The dark is where folks like I ply our trade...~
@11280 = ~Now dear, do you see how big these ears are? I can hear anything.~
@11281 = ~Yeah and they make you look stupid!~
@11282 = ~W-well your face looks stupid!~
@11283 = ~Wow you sound really stupid!~
@11284 = ~Now see here girl I'll... I'll... oh forget it.~
@11285 = ~This is why I will never have children...~
@11286 = ~N-never?~
@11287 = ~It is not the time for this conversation.~
@11288 = ~Ok dear...~
@11289 = ~Oh little girl! Would you like to play with Boo?~
@11290 = ~What's a Boo?~
@11291 = ~He is a miniature giant space hamster! He loves to play all kinds of fun games!~
@11292 = ~Uhh... it just looks like a rat.~
@11293 = ~Little girl, if you keep saying rude things like this, you will never have any friends!~
@11294 = ~It's tough playin' games when ya got no one to play with.~
@11295 = ~I gotta say... kinda feeling for her. Imagine how bored both of us woulda been back in Candlekeep if we didn't have each other? Woulda driven some of those monks to murder.~
@11296 = ~That actually sounds really tough. I'm sorry kid... I'd show you a magic trick, but I'm afraid I might accidentally teleport you under the ocean or turn you inside out.~
@11297 = ~Street urchins are the lifeblood of secrets in the city, and it seems things are not so different even in this filthy pile of northern refuse. Perhaps some dirt we can profit from later?~
@11298 = ~It would be irresponsible to invade his private space to snoop about his magic mirror... but uhh... can  we do it anyway? I am dying to know what's there.~
@11299 = ~A useful clue. Leave the brat to her nonsense and let us investigate this further.~
@11300 = ~Well, it certainly wasn't my song. My Raven, I think I will leave the maritime ballads to you.~
@11301 = ~Ah... no that is... oh I suppose what harm could it do... I suspect her impatience will get the better of her regardless.~
@11302 = ~Ah the turgid drama of a rustic town. It reminds me of my own halcyon days in a tiny gnomish village, a place you couldn't find on a map made by even the most obsessive cartographer (and I've known a few). The Jansen family had challenges of its own back then, what with the radish famine. Ma and Pa tried their hardest, but it wasn't long before they sat us down and asked each of us to get jobs to support the family. I was a precocious lad barely as tall as my waist is now and my littlest sister had only just barely finished swaddling, but our parents would have no layabouts around the house.~
@11303 = ~So we opened up my first turnip stand and thus started me down the fine path of the turnip salesman. I was never as good as my sister though. I've never met someone who mastered the art of the sale so quickly. Faster than she mastered speaking actual words even. Through a hypnotic series of goos and gaas, she could sell water to a merman. I've always been quite jealous of my little sister, but as they say, blood is thicker than turnip tea, so I could never bring myself to hate her.~
@11304 = ~Why are you still talking?~
@11305 = ~I ask myself that more and more often these days.~
@11306 = ~I do hope that she can find something a bit more productive to do with herself now that she's going back home.~
@11307 = ~Weee!~
@11308 = ~Get ye gone ya damndable little mouse and trouble us no longer!~
@11309 = ~Eeek!~
@11310 = ~How can you tell? You mean it isn't miserable like this just all the time?~
@11311 = ~Great... a southern "lady". Exactly what I don't need right now.~
@11312 = ~And thus avoids many of the pitfalls that come with family owned trading houses. It would be refreshing to have fewer 'noble' names in Trademeet.~
@11313 = ~What a fun song you were singing! Is it a fishing shanty?~
@11314 = ~Aye, that it be! Shanties keep the mind sharp at sea me'boy.~
@11315 = ~Indeed? Perhaps I need to branch out...~
@11316 = ~Well it's a pretty name at least. Most boats I've traveled on with names were just references to what was under the captain's breeches and fantastical attempts at overcompensation.~
@11317 = ~Give my consolations to your future wife.~
@11318 = ~Har! Ye sailor folks are alright.~
@11319 = ~Oh it seemed a lovely spot for a picnic. I expect we will find all sorts of spirited conversation to be had...~
@11320 = ~With ghosts. Spirited? As in spirits?~
@11321 = ~I mean to say we'll be speaking with the dead you nitwit! Damn your eyes!~
@11322 = ~The lights are on... but nobody's home...~
@11323 = ~A trap must be placed with care for its surroundings. Emmerich might not object to your trapping, rather than the obtuse way they are placed.~
@11324 = ~More like it's your dim-witted fingers he protests against.~
@11325 = ~Boo, stay away from this man. I do not want to see you turned into a hamster coinpurse!~
@11326 = ~Tell ‘im ta screw off, I've nae the patience fer book-humpers.~
@11327 = ~He has the appearance of a simple sage, but see there? The pendant just barely unconcealed at his neckline. The markings of some magic society no doubt.~
@11328 = ~He wants this information too badly for it to be an idle fancy. Likely he means harm to his intended target.~
@11329 = ~And what's that to you?~
@11330 = ~I be Yeslick Orothair of Cloakwood. Pleased to be meetin' you I am.~
@11331 = ~Ahh... well hail there Yeslick. A long way from home ye are~
@11332 = ~Aye that be true, but by Clangeddin a great need has called me north.~
@11333 = ~Moradin's blessins upon yer quest then Yeslick. May yer hammer always strike true.~
@11334 = ~And yers as well. Always a blessed day to meet kind kin from afar!~
@11335 = ~So you did not expect such an immediately hostile reaction from the barbarians. You couldn't have expected to scout the camp unnoticed.~
@11336 = ~I am sorry to hear of your losses. It's never easy to lose friends.~
@11337 = ~Ah lass, I appreciate the sentiment. They were good men.~
@11338 = ~We are investigating this matter as well. With luck, the death of your friends will not be in vain.~
@11339 = ~Well now, this one looks like quite the lush. Definitely seems to be *your* type <CHARNAME>. Go ahead and have at her!~
@11340 = ~Yes, well, that is what marriage gets you.~
@11341 = ~Eh if yer interested ‘o goin down south, I'll be glad ta take ye there soon as tonight (hehe)~
@11342 = ~Ew, get away from me.~
@11343 = ~Bah! A pox on ye ya witless strumpet!~
@11344 = ~Uhh... can we change the subject? I could really stand to hear less about what this woman is willing to debase herself for...~
@11345 = ~That reminds me of a series of books I used to sell under the counter heh. Made a pretty copper off those.~
@11346 = ~Now then, your husband sounds like he only wished the best for your family and your daughter has simply taken to the north. Your marriage was a sacred vow, you cannot abandon it so carelessly.~
@11347 = ~What?? She's lots of fun! We're going to go play hide and seek and make snow harpies later!~
@11348 = ~Dear gods ma'am, she is your child. You can't simply disown her. She may be a bit unruly, but you should be setting an example for her, not trolling about this tavern.~
@11349 = ~I've had just about enough of your high and mighty attitude. I don't care to speak of it no further.~
@11350 = ~Well played <CHARNAME>. I'll be here keeping the stools warm and have myself a few drinks. You go do what you need to do.~
@11351 = ~Indeed it is! Danger we do not fear, as long as the reward remains lucrative. ~
@11352 = ~Yer too eager fer me liking. Say plain whatcha want, or else we walk.~
@11353 = ~Intriguing. I believe that would be our specialty.~
@11354 = ~Well, there's truth to every story, but the longer the stories go, the more uhh... "decoration" it wears.~
@11355 = ~This seems unwise. This man is hiding something from us but also asking us to take his word on faith alone. Ah, lead as you will.~
@11356 = ~Heh, the motto I live by. Goes good with my other motto, ‘put an axe in anyone who tries to sell ya dirt sayin its gold'.~
@11357 = ~No. I am not happy! Oh dear... I want to go back home!~
@11358 = ~Great, now we find ourselves in the middle of nowhere, left to die in the sand. At least our bones will be well preserved.~
@11359 = ~We are far afield without a way back... for now. We should get into the castle quickly. If we are to find a way out, it will be in there. And besides, the sun will be particularly unpleasant outside.~
@11360 = ~You've told us a great many thing my friend except for one. The Truth. What are you hiding?~
@11361 = ~I... don't know what you're talking about.~
@11362 = ~Your secrets are a briar that you bind yourself within.~
@11363 = ~"The Luremaster"? That's.. Not a bad title...~
@11364 = ~It's nice... I guess. Seems like ya'd get really bored here though...~
@11365 = ~I tire of this halfling skirting around the truth. If he does not start talking, I will force his cooperation through magical persuasion.~
@11366 = ~He is quite frightened. I suspect he might be enslaved by some force. As much as I would like to know more, for his safety we may not want to pursue the point further.~
@11367 = ~Perhaps he is under the influence of some sort of gaes? Not that I myself would know much of the subject.~
@11368 = ~An irresistible mark for any adventurer looking for treasure and glory...~
@11369 = ~Akin to being trapped in one of the Lady's mazes. Usually tis only a man's sanity that flies free from such traps.~
@11370 = ~Some sort of dimensional anchor... what a dreadful fate to be held captive here until your body falls apart.~
@11371 = ~May I see the ring? Perhaps something in the enchantment might allow me to...~
@11372 = ~Afraid not friend. My soul is connected to it... if I take it off, it'll kill me. No mage I've met has been able to figure it out.~
@11373 = ~Thy ring may hold the key. Perhaps I might scry some...~
@11374 = ~Yeah, I think I do. No hard feelings. But don't worry, we're really good. We'll figure this whole thing out and you'll be free in no time.~
@11375 = ~You're sweet to say, but I've seen too many adventurers destroyed by this place to give me any hope.~
@11376 = ~Yeah, but you haven't seen nothin' like us.~
@11377 = ~Just what I need... some obnoxious fool blathering on while I tend to my wine...~
@11378 = ~Oh hey umm... my name is Nar... err Neera and I uhh... err...~
@11379 = ~Pardon me miss, but does your complexion often bloom like a rose so?~
@11380 = ~No! It's not red! I don't even... I err... I'm going to go over here now...~
@11381 = ~(Way to hold it together Neera. Soon as a cute guy speaks to you, you turn into a complete spaz...)~
@11382 = ~*giggles* You're quite funny. Do you ever do any performances? It's been a long time since I've seen a jester show.~
@11383 = ~Thank you ma'am for doing your part to ever keep my pride in check. Nay, there will be no performances for me tonight, however perhaps my simple company will amuse you enough.~
@11384 = ~Oh, but I'd love to hear it! I'm a bit of a collector of stories you see.~
@11385 = ~Well, it beats trudging about in the snow. Not a bad looking fellow at that...~
@11386 = ~Sing on good bard! It would do us well to rest our feet and partake in a bit of frivolity.~
@11387 = ~And then it will only be a matter of time until the horde turns to them. They're fools if they think that their walls are different from the next town's or that the tide will simply wash around them.~
@11388 = ~There is nothing ‘ironic' about it. That is simply the way of nature.~
@11389 = ~Strange that a wolf would happen to kill both brothers. Trappers they both may have been, but the chances of the same wolf just happening to kill both of them should be very slim... we should investigate further.~
@11390 = ~Then nature has decided they were not fit to live. Good riddance.~
@11391 = ~All on different days? That can't be a coincidence. Perhaps there is a will behind this wolf's actions.~
@11392 = ~Poor guy. But ya know, I betcha there is such a thing. He just hasn't looked in the right spot.~
@11393 = ~That was... so beautiful... and... I think I'm having some trouble breathing... I think I need to... go sit over there... again...~
@11394 = ~Ha! Not a bad tale... and with a riotous punchline to boot.~
@11395 = ~Fascinating! I think I have this all written down. Oh I'll make sure you're credited when I publish my book!~
@11396 = ~A fine tale indeed my melancholy magpie!~
@11397 = ~Bah! All this pamby singin' bout flowers and love has me feelin' sick. I'll thank ya ta shut yer yap at least till I've passed out and spare yerself me axe in yer gut.~
@11398 = ~What you're just gonna give the damn thing to him?! It could be worth a fortune ya git! When did I sign up for the charity brigade...?~
@11399 = ~Heh, good luck Murdaugh. We better get invited to the wedding!~
@11400 = ~Yeah umm ya know I hope it goes well and you know things work out and stuff just goes well and all of that and uhh... (oh gods kill me now)~
@11401 = ~We w-wish you the best! Love is a splendorous t-thing. T-treasure every moment.~
@11402 = ~Khalid, do not forget you have promised to rub my feet when we retire for the night.~
@11403 = ~Y-yes... treasure every... single... m-moment...~
@11404 = ~I do. I also know better than to hide my past in a closet an arm's length of where I sleep.~
@11405 = ~What? Say it isn't so! Whatever organization could possibly be so secretive, so insidious? I can scarce imagine what such a thing would be like! Please say more...~
@11406 = ~Yes, speak freely. We're all friends here... no prying ears or blades that I can see...~
@11407 = ~Monty, silence yourself! You'll give us away!~
@11408 = ~Oh how fortunate that your cloak did not once fly black. That might have been... unpleasant. For you, mostly.~
@11409 = ~Feh, and here I imagined you were being hunted by an organization of real power. A Hosttower mage's might pales in comparison to any Red Wizard.~
@11410 = ~That would also explain why there seems to be a will behind these killings. Werewolves do retain a semblance of their personality when transformed. ~
@11411 = ~Quite the establishment. I am glad that you are the one in charge now. My neck has a terrible allergy to rope.~
@11412 = ~That should prove an adequate solution, at least in the short term. I may have some more long term ideas on how to control his affliction.~
@11413 = ~Thank you for this. The notion of hunting Emmerich pleased me not.~
@11414 = ~Certainly only a temporary measure. With time spent in this party's company, I fear all of your efforts will have been for naught.~
@11415 = ~Unfortunately, I do not think a simple hope scroll will be enough to help your friend.~
@11416 = ~Who can blame it? Left to languish in a cold tower, possessed by a cursed man who is himself unable to die. To what resort would a sword have to free itself from such a lamentable condition...? *sigh*~
@11417 = ~Uhh is your friend over there ok?~
@11418 = ~Positively jolly.~
@11419 = ~I like not the look of this one <CHARNAME>. His stench is horrible and there's... something else about him, I cannot place.~
@11420 = ~Your identity was well chosen. Who would suspect a simple-minded gravedigger...~
@11421 = ~No! Your aura... I felt it but I didn't suspect this...~
@11422 = ~I certainly wouldn't blame you for it. What a pain.~
@11423 = ~He hired an assassin before he attempted to treat with them diplomatically? No wonder the Barbarians mistrusted them...~
@11424 = ~You cannot pre-empt an offer of peace with one of war. Because of this unthoughtfulness, an innocent man was murdered. Though perhaps, given what we know of Wylfdene, it mattered little at all.~
@11425 = ~You cannot seriously think to attack us when you are outnumbered and outmatched. This cannot end well for you.~
@11426 = ~Of course an assassin would run when he's not on the advantage. And a man no less! Coward! Face me you bastard!~
@11427 = ~I think not.~
@11428 = ~It's good work.~
@11429 = ~Thank you ser. Are you... familiar with barrel-making?~
@11430 = ~Not barrels specifically. Woodworking is a hobby of mine. Mostly furniture or animal figurines. Ah, but enough about that, I believe <CHARNAME> wished to speak to you.~
@11431 = ~Oh, but why would she play such cruel jokes? A girl her age should be painting or reading poetry or trying on dresses.~
@11432 = ~Skie dear, do these yokels look like they have paint or poetry books or fancy dresses?~
@11433 = ~Oh.. well I suppose not...~
@11434 = ~That's right. Now remember in the future to think before you talk. Or simply refrain from speaking at all.~
@11435 = ~Well m-maybe she's not coming home because she's worried you'll hit her. I don't... I don't think you should do that.~
@11436 = ~Oh? Are you sayin' she's *your* daughter then?~
@11437 = ~N-no but...~
@11438 = ~That's right, she ain't. You don't know what she's like. Don't tell me how to parent my kid.~
@11439 = ~She just needed to be reminded of her vows. Just as you need to be reminded that marriage is about compromise. Keep her needs in mind as well and do whatever you can to meet them.~
@11440 = ~I... I will remember that ser.~
@11441 = ~Does a bit of skimming off the top of everything does he? Heh, not a bad racket.~
@11442 = ~Who keeps telling these peasants that working harder will ever beat out working smarter? I bet they've made a fortune...~
@11443 = ~Leaving you in little better than indentured servitude.~
@11444 = ~Hmm... strange for there to be so secrecy. Perhaps the diplomat prefers his privacy? Or perhaps there was something more insidious at work.~
@11445 = ~Cultivate that imagination of hers. It will take her far, my hound.~
@11446 = ~Children should be neither seen nor heard, so this should no doubt be a great boon to this town.~
@11447 = ~Good to see her energy put to better use. She's a spirit girl and with proper direction perhaps capable of great things.~
@11448 = ~D-doesn't it make you want-~
@11449 = ~No. No children.~
@11450 = ~R-right... ok dear...~
@11451 = ~The phrase ‘thick as thieves' comes to mind...~
@11452 = ~*ahem* Thieves can be quite thin and all that are secretive are certainly not thieves.~
@11453 = ~A shame for such an exquisite creature to be caged as you are.~
@11454 = ~Spare me your sympathies you silly elf.~
@11455 = ~But then, perhaps some creatures are caged for the safety of the general public.~
@11456 = ~You seem to have a low opinion of your neighbors. It is not difficult to see why tensions between you have escalated so.~
@11457 = ~You have nothing to fear. Adventurers we are and of the highest caliber. I myself have experiences dealing with savage peoples in both diplomatic and martial capacities.~
@11458 = ~It is a rather exposed position. Were the barbarians to attack, you would be as the lone traveler facing down a sudden avalanche. Lonelywood would likely disappear under the onslaught.~
@11459 = ~Looking upon the town, you do not exactly have a defensible position. No walls, few weapons, and fewer that would be trained to use them.~
@11460 = ~In a situation as dire as this one it seems that you might use all the help that you can get. What can it hurt for us to aid as well?~
@11461 = ~A diplomat who also has the talents to slip around a blockade undetected? He must be an interesting fellow if nothing else.~
@11462 = ~Too interesting if you ask me. Sounds more like a spy than a diplomat.~
@11463 = ~Tis not a thing any with faith in Tempus would lie about. Tempus would never condone such duplicities.~
@11464 = ~His blood quickens. His lying is inept.~
@11465 = ~Of course they couldn't. No matter where you are, politics seems to be one multiversal constant.~
@11466 = ~And you brought many other interesting ideas to the table? No, I would bet you were relieved to have the decision taken out of your fumbling hands.~
@11467 = ~What kind of an assassin would be interested in gabbin about politics the night before a kill?~
@11468 = ~You were to be his contact in town yet neither of you spoke to his purpose for being there? That makes little sense for an assassin.~
@11469 = ~Any professional would want a situation update when they arrived. Your assassin is either unconventional, incompetent, or something else entirely.~
@11470 = ~It may be too little too late, but it's something at least. Assuming he's not simply paying us lip service.~
@11471 = ~You look like the brains of this little operation! Well, for as much as that's worth...~
@11472 = ~Watch your tone. I'll gladly trade a mouth full of knuckles for a belly full of steel to any man.~
@11473 = ~You'd be surprised how many humans are dumb enough to walk into jaws of bone and flesh. Your surprise would be short lived.~
@11474 = ~I'm sorry for your loss but maybe it's not a good idea to go out checking the traps when you're drunk?~
@11475 = ~Whatcha talkin' about? He was drunk most every time he checked for traps. He's only lost two fingers trappin, it's perfectly safe.~
@11476 = ~I was just thinking to myself how much smarter this town looked when we came back in.~
@11477 = ~And thus the overall intelligence quotient of this town increases by a significant margin.~
@11478 = ~It seems you and your brothers have drawn the attention of some fel beast. Heh, too bad for you.~
@11479 = ~Of magical properties this beast does seem to possess. It may be wise to procure silver if hunting it is our intention.~
@11480 = ~A Ranger does not summon wolves, magical ones no less, you foolish man.~
@11481 = ~Or perhaps you have simply offended nature and now she has chosen to take your life in return.~
@11482 = ~A-woo hoo! Uh... sorry, I don't know what came over me there...~
@11483 = ~The Fentans were always a bit of the odd-ones out as well. It is not common for halfling folk to enter commercial spheres, but we certainly can excel at them when we apply ourselves.~
@11484 = ~I couldn't have said it better myself.~
@11485 = ~I can always respect a man trying to make his fortune out on the edges of the world.~
@11486 = ~Why thank you. The greatest opportunities come from the most unlikely of places.~
@11487 = ~The insight provided by a local woodsman would be of invaluable assistance.~
@11488 = ~Then you are a ranger like Minsc? You protect the small animals and punish evil-doers?~
@11489 = ~Perhaps once I did but now... it is complicated.~
@11490 = ~Complicated? It is not complicated to kick the butt of evil!~
@11491 = ~If only we could all be so lucky to have such clarity of purpose.~
@11492 = ~Tiax is unimpressed by this Silvanus. All the forests will be cut down and burned to create a great pyre when he ascends to power!~
@11493 = ~If it was the Oak-Father's will that you die, you would have. Why have you not taken revenge on these brothers for violating the sanctity of nature as you should have?~
@11494 = ~That would be murder... even though they do wrong, I cannot simply kill them in cold blood.~
@11495 = ~Bah! You will never have the Oak-Father's blessing with such weakness of heart.~
@11496 = ~No, this does not seem like the way of Silvanus. I would sooner suspect a third party at work here.~
@11497 = ~An excess of trapping can lead to animals feeling cornered and becoming more aggressive, it is true. However Nature is more likely to react through gradual changes than by sending out a single avatar of vengeance, so this seems most strange still.~
@11498 = ~A killer. Embrace it and walk the path to true power.~
@11499 = ~And of course this simple woodsman possessed not the smallest spark of intelligence required to make this basic deduction.~
@11500 = ~Gods have mercy on me...~
@11501 = ~If I may, control over your form can be achieved through a strict diet and meditations. I can write down some instructions for you. Practice them each day and perhaps one day you may not even require the amulet at all.~
@11502 = ~I know not that I can trust myself... but I will try.~
@11503 = ~The civilized people do not give these so called "savages" enough credit. They are more perceptive than they appear.~
@11504 = ~Well then, yet again my humble turnip selling roots have given me away. There's really no hiding it. A glimmer in every turnip salesman's eye that sticks with them until the day they die, and you're savvy to see it.~
@11505 = ~It's possible the fact that we're armed to the teeth with enchanted gear may have given us away.~
@11506 = ~We have learned well from the cowardice of the Ten-Towns so far.~
@11507 = ~I respect you do us this honor, but Tempus teaches we should never battle without cause. Think carefully on if thy reason holds merit.~
@11508 = ~Admittance of guilt under extreme torture is no proof at all. Whatever this Wylfdene's goals, he seems to be committed to ensuring a peaceful resolution is not an option.~
@11509 = ~So a possibly innocent man was subjected to torture before any proof was brought up to incriminate him? It would be perhaps naive of me to assume a lawful process of justice was given to the convicted among barbarians.~
@11510 = ~Maybe if they read a book? Ya ever see a book before? Bits'a paper strung together that magically let ya know stuff that happened in the past. They're pretty neat.~
@11511 = ~Cease your mocking this instant!~
@11512 = ~Ok fine, but only 'cause ya asked politely.~
@11513 = ~Aww... but a first hand telling of the Great Wylfdene's deed's would.... Oh fine I'll put away my quill and ink.~
@11514 = ~This man speaks as one who knows nature's heart. I'd join him against the towns in an instant... yet something dissuades me from it... some *corruption* that I feel festering within the flesh and blood he inhabits.~
@11515 = ~That is hardly fair. Nature's bounty is owned by all and no one at all. By asserting this land and its "treasures" are yours, you show it little more respect than those you despise. ~
@11516 = ~Ok, gotta admit, that one looks kinda bad.~
@11517 = ~Surely the Easthaveners can share it with you. Or... perhaps they could find a neutral ground to place it at...~
@11518 = ~Tis one and the same god! Tempus is not a god of words, he is one of action. He cares not what you call him, only that you follow his examples!~
@11519 = ~He speaks under the pretense that peace is an option he's interested in at all.~
@11520 = ~Oh can ye ever forgive me fer not puttin on me frilly tunic and tutu... ye beslubberin' whey-face bugbear...~
@11521 = ~Finally! I've had enough of all this jawing. I see among you not a single woman. Time for you to see what a real warrior can do...~
@11522 = ~Thy story is remarkable... you woulds't be a true herald of Tempus... yet it seems to mine ears to be too good to be true.~
@11523 = ~The transmogrification of two souls into one singular is an extremely rare occurrence across all of history. This woulds't be unprecedented in this age.~
@11524 = ~I see only three forks in this entire mead hall and one of them is to the *left* of a knife... what else are we supposed to think...~
@11525 = ~A shallow excuse for cravenness. What mighty warlord backs down so quickly from a challenge?~
@11526 = ~Yet see how his invoking of tradition lets him avoid conflict while seeming strong to his people? He chooses his words well...~
@11527 = ~It's a surpriiiiise!~
@11528 = ~I can't think of a scraggly group of people who would need a mirror more...~
@11529 = ~Sometimes I miss mirrors. Well, not mirrors themselves but my reflection rather. It's quite difficult to do my hair the way I like without. Ah, is this not a good time? Apologies.~
@11530 = ~A noble animal spirit, enslaved to guard human remains. We must free it from its servitude by any means, even if we must kill it ourselves.~
@11531 = ~Bah! You think Tiax can be marked in such a way? No, it is Tiax who marks all the world around him! None are the same after they meet him...~
@11532 = ~It seems our dear chieftain's rising offended these spirits. Another good clue that his claims are false.~
@11533 = ~A mark on us? No, I should have felt any such impurities! It can't be so...~
@11534 = ~While I understand the sentiment, that is perhaps a bit extreme.~
@11535 = ~Any who wishes to witness my full power is welcome to try and destroy me...~
@11536 = ~<CHARNAME>, if we are indeed infected by some corrupting element, we must get to the bottom of this. I... do not wish my soul to be stained by this! Please!~
@11537 = ~You sir are a fisherman as much as I am a turnip salesman. Which is to say, completely so and without any doubt! Greetings to you!~
@11538 = ~He sure is wearing a lot of magic stuff for a fisherman. Unless he catches magical fish that is. Hmm...~
@11539 = ~Boo and I are glad to hear that you will be getting better!~
@11540 = ~Is he contagious? Should we really be so close to him?~
@11541 = ~You're more genial than most Necromancers I've known.~
@11542 = ~It may have *cough* not always been so. But watching one's body slowly *cough* waste away does tend to humble you.~
@11543 = ~*sigh* I can't do anything to help him in that case. Perhaps... perhaps I can beseech Baervan to help or...~
@11544 = ~No child... I appreciate your offer but I deserve the special attention of no god.~
@11545 = ~But I... I just wish I could help.~
@11546 = ~Thank you for your concern. It means enough to know that there are some as caring as you in this world.~
@11547 = ~And so you, once a mighty mage, has given up and allowed yourself to simply fade away? I would pity you if you deserved any more than my contempt.~
@11548 = ~No, it would be a pleasant end to the suffering of wasting away. Then again, so would just about any end. I cannot imagine how you continue on each day.~
@11549 = ~Mostly by focusing on the little things. The smell of the dew, the sound of the waves, an old familiar book in hand by a candle in the evening. I've also found a joy in fishing that I never imagined I could have when I was younger.~
@11550 = ~It sounds miserable.~
@11551 = ~Death is the antidote for a great many ailments. Ah, but better you than me as they say.~
@11552 = ~An admirable perspective to have, especially for a mage. I wish you well for the rest of your days.~
@11553 = ~They are quite a severe people. It's a shame. Even just a little forgiveness can grow into great things.~
@11554 = ~That is a fan club I do *not* want to be a part of.~
@11555 = ~Compelled... they serve because their wills are enslaved, not willingly. What a lamentable condition...~
@11556 = ~I suspect that they may not count vampires among the permitted.~
@11557 = ~Your soul is as tainted as can be.~
@11558 = ~A word aside if I could, my Raven? If a Glabrezu he is, then I would warn against making any bargains unless you hold his true name. To a native of the outer planes, this seems common knowledge, but Primes are ever clueless about such things.~
@11559 = ~Whilst I caution from dealing with such fiends, powerful scrying may reveal the fiend's name.~
@11560 = ~He just forgot your name, just like that? Wow, I guess it wasn't true love after all. So sad.~
@11561 = ~DO NOT DARE MOCK ME!~
@11562 = ~<CHARNAME>, hold! This is highly inadvisable. Such demonic arrangements always doom those who enter into them.~
@11563 = ~No, <CHARNAME>, you mustn't let pride cloud your judgement! This demon will undo you.~
@11564 = ~If power this demon offers, I say we take it. Why leave it otherwise unclaimed for our enemies to use against us?~
@11565 = ~Hah! Your essence will fuel our conquests wretch! You should feel honored.~
@11566 = ~Gah! Your soul has already been sworn to another Blackguard!~
@11567 = ~Tiernon... nay... it cannae be so. Ye... I be honored ta be in yer presence.~
@11568 = ~I've heard tales of a great dwarven smith of clan Hearthstone who disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Could this be the great weaponsmith himself?! Do you think he'd give me an autograph?~
@11569 = ~A wise position under most circumstance. I see but one tiny flaw in your reasoning. Well, two as a matter of fact.~
@11570 = ~Tis odd that she wouldst think her death we bring. But then the sight often shows circumstance without motive. Her death may be'ist part of a grander tale.~
@11571 = ~A dwarf with skill at illusions? Preposterous!~
@11572 = ~I... I would have figured it out!~
@11573 = ~Then it was a mercy she let you keep your life. It is more than I've left any who have found me from the dark home I left...~
@11574 = ~The paranoid can often be accused of taking extreme action. Still, it makes a sense in a way. You would be likely unable to find your way home and if you did doubly so your way back.~
@11575 = ~*gasp* Ye speak truly? The call... still I await mine...~
@11576 = ~Speak for yourself. Was never forges that drew me. Mints on the other hand... heh.~
@11577 = ~Nay, just kinship for what comes outta them. Specifically what's made ta kill a man.~
@11578 = ~Nay, just kinship for what comes outta them, specifically what's made ta kill a man.~
@11579 = ~But a dwarf can die happy knowin his greatest craft is behind him.~
@11580 = ~Forging ice? The elements of fire and ice rarely cooperate in such a manner. However nature often provides a bounty to those who find complementing contrasts. Perhaps it is not such an impossibility.~
@11581 = ~Have ye lost your mind? Tis... tis not right for a dwarf to stray so far from trusty stone and metal!~
@11582 = ~I wouldn't nae expect ye to understand.~
@11583 = ~Congratulations are in order my hound! You have crafted a weapon which spits in the face of reality and revels in the impossibility of its creation! Quite the uncommon sight in the Prime.~
@11584 = ~A truly remarkable work. I had not believed it was possible to create such a thing... even now I question its existence. ~
@11585 = ~The craftsmanship is... remarkable. Yet still... it spits upon what it is to be dwarf. I just... I cannae condone it in good faith.~
@11586 = ~Yes please, take it. Let's not have come all this way and not gotten *something* valuable out of it.~
@11587 = ~Whoa there... someone's got some issues he needs to work out...~
@11588 = ~Boo, why does the old dwarf speak to the sword like he does? Does he not know that it cannot understand him?~
@11589 = ~I really *really* hope you've never had a wife...~
@11590 = ~Oh yes, I certainly could help. But I won't. Why? Oh wouldn't you like to know... does the curiosity eat away at you, like maggots on a corpse? Most excellent...~
@11591 = ~Have care. A seer's words can be a terrible thing. More deadly than the sharpest steel or most potent spell.~
@11592 = ~Oh dying wasn't all that.~
@11593 = ~Tis a dire premonition. To see one's own death and be powerless to stop its coming... for the veil of freedom of thine will to be rended so thin. I would fare no better with such knowledge.~
@11594 = ~You've seen the climax before the curtains have even lifted? What a disappointment that would be.~
@11595 = ~Tiax has not seen his own death... his life is never ending!~
@11596 = ~Tis a relief to know for sure... yet such a great offense to Tempus to defile the names and bodies of not just one, but two mighty warriors!~
@11597 = ~Due to magical enhancement or...? I can't think of a property of ice that would keep a... creature like this away.~
@11598 = ~I tire of her inane rambling. If she does not do so more clearly then I suggest we take a more forceful approach.~
@11599 = ~A woman's heart that can hold no love is a tragic thing indeed. Tragic and terrible.~
@11600 = ~She makes it sound so sad... but there can be no hope for it, can there?~
@11601 = ~A good a place as any to search. And if nothing else, ridding the north of this tribe sounds like it may be a worthy goal in its own right.~
@11602 = ~They do not sacrifice in Tiax's name?! The heresy of it! Tiax will smite them all!~
@11603 = ~It is difficult to find fault in your actions. You sought a better future for your people. It is only a shame that you were mislead.~
@11604 = ~Uhh, creepy. <CHARNAME>, promise me you won't use my bones for a dinner table or nothin' if I die. ~
@11605 = ~No really? Gosh, seems to make the place positively homey to me.~
@11606 = ~But it provides for such interesting dinner conversation. Whose skull is it over there with the most interesting lump on the left side? Take it from me, the bones of strangers and loved ones alike bring endless topics to otherwise dull affairs.~
@11607 = ~What peace? We've killed everything on our way down here. No reason to stop now.~
@11608 = ~The only peace will be bought with the death of this wyrm. She has ensured this much already.~
@11609 = ~That's nae a bother ta me. Was hankerin fer some fish anyway.~
@11610 = ~That sounds very sad. I'm... sorry.~
@11611 = ~Do not grieve for me. It is necessary that I do this. We all must sacrifice in our own way for our people.~
@11612 = ~If only you knew the attention you had brought to yourself. Now you face the Children of Bhaal.~
@11613 = ~You probably haven't heard of us on account of bein so old, but we're kind of a big deal.~
@11614 = ~She's a lich... of a kind anyway.~
@11615 = ~Such is the way of war and conquest. Do not expect us to weep as children for your downfall.~
@11616 = ~And their loutish ways will disappear with them and the world will be a better place for it.~
@11617 = ~Do you really value people's traditions and culture so little? So be it.~
@11618 = ~It is truly a shame when such things are lost. However the preservation of the past cannot come with the price of the death of the present.~
@11619 = ~The present is a fleeting thing. It is the past that builds the future. The present is only transition.~
@11620 = ~I wonder how much this "kindred spirit" approves of you desecrating his body and perverting the purpose of his people to fulfill your own vengeance.~
@11621 = ~Does it matter now, truly?~
@11622 = ~Tis not just Wylfdene you defiled, but the name of Jerod as well.~
@11623 = ~And I suppose this offends you greatly, little priestess. I care not.~
@11624 = ~Then we will just have to swing our swords harder!~
@11625 = ~Perhaps one day the cycle will spin again in the favor of your race. But that day is not today. Fade away, as you should have so long ago.~
@11626 = ~Then oblivion it shall be! Worry not, we shall all meet you shortly; in the inevitable absence of all things at the end of time.~
@11627 = ~And you'd be so bold to proclaim as such? I suppose I should be thankful to know exactly where you stand.~
@11628 = ~This is exactly what I don't need right now. Begone spirit, we care not for your "trials".~
@11629 = ~But Minsc and Boo are already heroes! You shall see!~
@11630 = ~It seems this spirit seeks to conduct a play in which our roles have already been set. *sigh* It is a tiresome script that we dance to.~
@11631 = ~Oh oh, do we get a gold star? How about a sticker of some kind? A magnetic stone I can send to my mom so she can put it up on the food cooler that reads: ‘Best Hero in class'?~
@11632 = ~And so we continue to perform his play with only the barest script to read from. Ah well, this sparrow always did have a penchant for improvisation.~
@11633 = ~I begin to see the method in this spirit's madness. He needed someone to carry the story of this place away. But still, he seems committed to making it a difficult task.~
@11634 = ~Suits me just fine. Was gettin' tired of all this barmy-brained double speakin. Sure ‘nuff, we keep killin, a way'll open up to show us out.~
@11635 = ~I haven't felt like this since the time I got lost in my great aunt's turnip farm. She grew them big, with stems that went up higher than the eye could see. And if you were an intrepid young gnome with a bit of the mid-day munchies, it wasn't hard to find yourself lost in the thick of it while hankering for a treat. Of course there it wasn't starvation you had to worry about but having your stomach burst from eating too much. Starvation at least has a way of making your mind keen... too many turnips and your mind and body move as slow as molasses. Speaking of... anyone else a bit peckish?~
@11636 = ~No. Just tell him no. We've entertained this ghost's fancies long enough. *sigh* Were it ever so easy...~
@11637 = ~And despite your appreciation, you'll undoubtedly not give us a choice in the matter.~
@11638 = ~Why must such things always be done with violence. Isn't there a better way to put the spirits to rest than by fighting them?~
@11639 = ~That would be nice wouldn't it?~
@11640 = ~Fear not! Tales will speak of Minsc and Boo and friends for all time!~
@11641 = ~Yes, great, FINE. We've indulged this pointless nostalgia long enough! Remove us from here.~
@11642 = ~Great deeds speak for themselves. It's not our mission to ensure they are remembered but to just do the right thing and the other will follow.~
@11643 = ~We're not interested in being remembered. We're just doing what seems right and trying to make it to tomorrow.~
@11644 = ~I still wonder that myself... But no, a dream is something you can wake up from and usually things will still be alright. Well, unless they aren't.~
@11645 = ~Even a moment's weakness and indecision can lead you very far astray. You should have kept the teachings of Tyr closer to heart.~
@11646 = ~Yes... I am aware of that now. So painfully aware.~
@11647 = ~There is always hope brother. Tyr is a just god, he will understand... if you'd but make the attempt.~
@11648 = ~Bah, if you won't end this wretch, step out of the way. I'll not stand his bawling a moment longer.~
@11649 = ~Is anyone else thirsty? Hmm... but his veins are practically dry. I'd hardly get a sip from him.~
@11650 = ~I... am unsure what the right course of action here. Surely he deserves some measure of peace, but is death really the only way it can be given?~
@11651 = ~The wolf does not ask the fawn for a name before eating. If your intention is to devour us, then you need not know our names either. ~
@11652 = ~The only name you need to know is that of my weapon, foul thing. As you can see, I've scrawled it onto the side so that it may brand those who challenge us.~
@11653 = ~You don't even realize you're in a cage... you're nothing but vultures who can't see anything but the scraps thrown to you.~
@11654 = ~You must be unfamiliar with the phrase that you attract more flies with honey instead of vinegar. Perhaps you would like to rephrase your questions in a more friendly manner?~
@11655 = ~Be on your guard. This is not the same halfling coward we encountered outside.~
@11656 = ~An evasive answer. Continue to chase this line of questioning and whatever this thing truly is, its nature will be revealed to us.~
@11657 = ~Oh yeah, we're real old buddies. Go waaaaay back. Remember that time you trapped us in this desert all of minutes after we met you? Good times.~
@11658 = ~At least we find one friendly being in these depths. Your assistance would be well met friend.~
@11659 = ~More akin to my own druidic circle then. Yet I've seen little more control from your peers than the common werewolf.~
@11660 = ~A portal away from this place? Speak now, I will not permit remaining here a moment's longer than necessary.~
@11661 = ~He's referring to the fall of Netheril, I think. Woulda been ages they've been down here...~
@11662 = ~It's to be a treasure hunt then? *sigh* What better way to pass the time in such a lovely dank cave?~
@11663 = ~My Raven! Fire and cinder all around. We are in the midst of a symphony. Shall we step on the stage and become players ourselves? Lead on!~
@11664 = ~Oh dear, this looks horrible! We should check on the people here to make sure they're ok before we talk to... whoever here is in charge. It looks like they've done more damage to their town on their own than the goblins will.~
@11665 = ~Must we journey to a place so damnably miserable?! The cold is bad enough, ye bring us to a siege as well? You would do well to remember that I expect to be paid for my hardships in gold or I'll take it in blood instead...~
@11666 = ~It's not enough I have to be dragged along on the surface, I must be brought to the most INHOSPITABLE AND VIOLENT place on it?! What did I ever do to deserve this? Did I beat my slaves too hard? Did I beat them not hard enough? Oh just forget it... lead the way...~
@11667 = ~This is so so exciting! How far do you think we are from my home now? Oh I never imagined we'd go this far. And it gave me a reason to wear this wonderful coat my father had commissioned for me for my 14th birthday. Isn't it lovely? Actual winter wolf fur. It's so soft... Uh so how long do you think we'll be staying anyway? Maybe... maybe we should go back soon?~
@11668 = ~We travel far and wide to spread word of Tiax's rule to the most distant lands! Blood and thunder in Tiax's name! Kneel before Tiax and he may show you mercy. Tiax demands groveling!~
@11669 = ~Why is nobody groveling! I will smite you ALL!~
@11670 = ~The north's got an infestation! Goblins, an ancient foe to my people. By Clanggedin's will, green heads will roll this day!~
@11671 = ~I suppose my wanderings were bound to lead here eventually, this most isolated and desolate of regions. And few so dangerous as the present situation shows... Ah well let us take a chance shall we? For whatever dangers ahead lies even greater rewards!~
@11672 = ~Ya' know, when I promised ta' stick with ya ta the s of Faerun an' back, I didn't think ya'd take it so literal! Oh <CHARNAME> what're ya gettin us inta now?~
@11673 = ~Was such a long trek really necessary? I appreciate the need of these people but beware thou art deferring thy destiny for quite some time in such a journey.~
@11674 = ~Do you enjoy taking me up to the arse end of Faerun simply to give me torment? This place ill-suits one of my stature and I strongly suggest we go back south immediately! (perhaps the only language these philistines understand is a fireball to the face)~
@11675 = ~There is great need of stalwart warriors in these northern climes. Helm's justice does not often reach the people who live here, and they have clearly suffered for it. With his guiding hand we will show them a better way.~
@11676 = ~Seems we have a siege on our hands. Plenty of money to be made in times like these. Could extort the natives for help or simply gather what goods we can and let demand sort out the prices heh heh. ~
@11677 = ~I must confess that the boat ride has left me... rather ill. I can balance on a pin but these legs were never made for sea. Allow me a moment to center myself and then I will be ready to aid against this attack.~
@11678 = ~Are we lost? Cause last I remember we were headed to... well it couldn't have been here. I mean, I get it, it's pretty embarrassing pulling the boat aside and asking for directions. So you go a few thousand leagues, pretending you meant to take the 'scenic route' all along and... I mean I guess since we're here we might as well fight some goblins or... ok ok shutting up now.~
@11679 = ~Bitter cold mixed with the scent of death and the sound of steel striking steel. A fine cocktail for the senses. Death comes to Targos this day.~
@11680 = ~Things fare ill here. The invading force seems to be mostly composed of goblins however I spotted a few orcs and larger goblinoids among them as we made our way here. Individually they should present little problem but together they have considerable strength. Let's move fast and use their unwieldy numbers to our advantage.~
@11681 = ~Row row row our boat, gently down the stream. Merrily merrily merrily merrily life is but a dream. Row row row our boat, gently down the stream. Merrily merrily merrily merrily life is but a dream. DO NOT DISRUPT ME. I am in the middle of impeccable cogitation and I'll disembowel anyone who disturbs me further! Now where was I? Oh yes... Row row row our boat, gently down...~
@11682 = ~Travel by sea... it is an oddly familiar experience. In the Underdark, the darkness around you seems unceasing, just as the water at all sides. But if one can persist and survive it long enough, they eventually find daylight, or land. I would prefer we do it as little as possible.~
@11683 = ~Why, a Jansen hasn't been this far north since my great aunt Pembersam went white wyrm hunting. She didn't bear the dragons any ill will, of course, but she had heard that their breath could freeze turnip juice into a delightful treat. She would bait them by making rather overt implications of the diminutive size of the hoards they sat on (if you get my meaning) and when the dragons swooped down on her she would hide behind a rock and throw a bucket of turnip juice in the air. She lost a foot to frostbite, but she came home with turnip-cicles in tow, so a successful venture all things considered.~
@11684 = ~You brought me here to kill didn't you? There's nothing else to talk about then. Just stay out of my way and I'll route this horde myself.~
@11685 = ~I question the decision to come up this far. Wealth there may be, but not without significant danger. Why don't we simply retire back to the inn, board ourselves away and drink until the siege passes us, and then journey back south to woo the gold from the purse of some duchess?~
@11686 = ~The humanoid races squabble over their petty town while nature suffers underneath their tantrum. If only they could meet mutual destruction quickly and allow nature to reclaim the land taken from her.~
@11687 = ~Yes of course, I'm sure the Bhaalspawn crisis will simply wait while we traipse around slaughtering goblins. Unbelievable.~
@11688 = ~Gosh there sure are a lot of frowns around here! You're all being attacked, I get it I get it. That's no reason to be so grumpy! I suppose we gotta do something to cheer everyone up around here huh?~
@11689 = ~A goblin siege? Well this certainly recalls my last campaign in the Order, defing a mountain town against giant and ogre alike. Goblins are a small measure in comparison. Stand behind me for safety, I will bring these cretins low.~
@11690 = ~Oh no. <CHARNAME> we should disembark quickly. Every m-moment we waste another life is at risk. W-we should secure the docks and make sure there is no d-danger here and then aid in the siege. L-l-let's go!~
@11691 = ~It is a gratifying thing that you are always looking for new horrible places for us to die in. At least the snow is an easy thing to dig out one's own grave rather than the hard earth.~
@11692 = ~As the shark is drawn to blood in the water, it seems we are drawn to the violence and need of this northern town. While I certainly empathize with the needs of these people, I do wonder what has driven the goblin peoples to such an army. Balance dictates that there must be a reason behind it. I will give it further consideration after we have addressed the immediate needs of the situation.~
@11693 = ~Ohhh the injustice! The evil! This place stinks of it. Boo, you must steel yourself and hold on tight. Minsc's wrath will not be contained! RAUUUUUUGHH!!!~
@11694 = ~Coming up to the North by boat was just about the smartest idea I ever had! It will take a great mind to find a way to break this siege. Go play in the snow or something and then prepare to be wowed by the amazing plan I come up with.~
@11695 = ~I would take a moment to admire the pristine lake and mountains around us, but it seems we have arrived too late. <CHARNAME>, we must stem this tide before they overrun the town. There will be time to appreciate the scenery later.~
@11696 = ~I could smell the goblin and orc stench long before we arrived in port. My bow is primed and my aim will be true. ~
@11697 = ~I missed the feeling of being on a boat. The gentle sway underneath you, rocking up and down and up and... oh where was I? Ah yes, we're to aid this town against some goblin horde? I suppose it's too much to hope we could just sail off to the next port town? No? Oh fine...~
@11698 = ~You do enjoy traveling off the beaten path don't you fri? Ha! As long as we return back to Amn before too long, it'll certainly be a new experience. But let us not tarry long... I would not like to think of your friend in that mage's grasp for too long.~
@11699 = ~Hmm, you wish me to help in saving this town? This isn't normally my raison d'être but I suppose I will do so. Besides, it won't do well for everyone here to be dead if I am feeling a bit... thirsty.~
@11700 = ~Uneventful journeys lead to dull tales but it seems that this was simply a moment of rest before we sailed into a storm of a great siege! I'll have to keep my parchment and quill in hand...~
@11701 = ~Do you see the way the houses here have been stripped for lumber? Only in the poorest area of the town, I am sure their owners had little say in the matter. I hope by the time we break this siege those people have a place left for them.~
@11702 = ~Is everyone here and accounted for? We are fortunate a fiery arrow did not find our boat on the way into port. First, we must l our hand to the aid of this town at once. Gather yourselves and let us set forth!~
@11703 = ~Ah, we journey to the realm where Tempus forges his mightiest warriors! Glory we will find here in no small measure. Sound the war horns, we charge!~
@11704 = ~Hmm things are grim here I see. You were right to take us this way to help these people, whatever our needs in Amn were. I hope Maria is as understanding...~
@11705 = ~Gimmie off this rickety floatin casket! Dwarves nae belong on boats and I'm itchin fer some violence to sooth the nerves. These green dung-flingers picked a poor time ta have me ire...~
@11706 = ~Umm... ew? Can we please not talk about that kind of thing. Father never let others talk like that around me... ohhh I'm never having fish again...~
@11707 = ~These men are shirking their duties so they can continue to slack off at the tavern? The defense of the city would be better off without these vagabonds.~
@11708 = ~Perfect, better off without us. Suits me just fine.~
@11709 = ~Har! These canker-blossoms may have the right of it. What use is standin on a wall while there's drinkin ta be done. Let the goblins come to us an we'll cleave em when they come.~
@11710 = ~Haha! Come this way you crotch rotted simpletons! After I'm done with you your own mothers won't be able to recognize you.~
@11711 = ~This feisty bitch is mine.~
@11712 = ~Ya know, I bet "Mercenary" used to be a respectable term until these guys took up the profession. Might be a smart idea to start thinking of a new way to refer to ourselves before they drive "Adventuring Company" into the ground too.~
@11713 = ~<CHARNAME>, it appears that you have fractured their resolve for delinquency with well chosen words. I commend you for finding the non-violent path.~
@11714 = ~So *now* these ruffians are concerned with their honor? Of course these hooligans can only do the right thing when a guillotine is hung above their head. We'd better to have flogged them as an example but ahh, it was your decision of course.~
@11715 = ~Haha, these dullards have been outthought! Truly my brilliance and wording... err word... smith...ery... (there has to be a better word for that) knows no boundaries!~
@11716 = ~Hmph. It's almost as if these craven bastards are asking for us to kill them. I'm leaning toward granting them their wish.~
@11717 = ~Laws right? Such an inconvenience.~
@11718 = ~Well hello beautiful... maybe you'd like to join us in our drink?~
@11719 = ~I think not. There's just a touch too much testosterone at this table for my tastes and by the look of your purses, you don't have enough to afford my 'pretend to be interested' fee.~
@11720 = ~"Wee folk." How quaint. Wonder how quaint and 'wee' he'll be thinking we are when I stick the back of his knee...~
@11721 = ~They are base villains taking the guise of "adventurers" for credibility. I doubt an argument to their conscience will sway them.~
@11722 = ~Somehow I doubt that these people will ever be featured in a song. You don't find too many odes about the heroic adventurers that stayed in the tavern until the villain came to them.~
@11723 = ~Why these... t-these men are no better than the goblins. They leach from the t-town while it is in p-peril and don't raise an arm except to l-lift their tankards. We should just l-leave.~
@11724 = ~I concur with Khalid. We're wasting our time with them. It's not worth the effort to motivate sloths. We'd spend our time better preparing other defenses.~
@11725 = ~Now there's the real tragedy. I thought that the north at least had half-decent ale. What else here would even be worth protecting?~
@11726 = ~In my circle, we would prepare a very strong fermented berry wine in rain barrels. *chuckles* When they were cracked open on hot summer nights, the revelries we got up to were often considered very undruid-like. But then there are many misconcep...~
@11727 = ~You sure do like to hear yourself talk don't you flower man?~
@11728 = ~No I... ah but you're just being abrasive now. Point taken.~
@11729 = ~You're a sucker if you think the gold in your purse will always outweigh a notice of debt. I love gold as much as the next dwarf, but even I understand that gold always bends to red ink.~
@11730 = ~I like not the look of this so called... keg. Tis a most disturbing demeanor to it.~
@11731 = ~The keg is planning something. I can feel it in my very bones.~
@11732 = ~You have made a powerful enemy this day... KEG.~
@11733 = ~Oh ho, I volunteer to show this man directly how much we know of "battle". What? Bah, fine, I sheathe my sword... for now.~
@11734 = ~Son, I've been engaging in battle since well before you were born. Show some respect to your elders.~
@11735 = ~I assure you w-we can hold our own quite fine sir. Allow us to t-take care of this please.~
@11736 = ~Aww who's a sweet fluffy kitty? You are! You are! Ow! It scratched me! Dumb jerk cat...~
@11737 = ~Edwin Odesseiron stands on his own but if you have cunning enough to get out of my way, you may benefit yet from the devastation I will unleash upon the horde attacking your town (though I have no doubts their appreciation to their savior will be lacking)~
@11738 = ~Are you mistaking me with a full blooded orc? Answer carefully as your life hangs on your next few words you cur.~
@11739 = ~Err... no! I didn't think... that is to say I wasn't... I...~
@11740 = ~Feh, cease your sniveling. My blade is stayed... for now.~
@11741 = ~What craven villain would assist goblins in overrunning a town? By Helm if this is the case, may they be judged swiftly and harshly.~
@11742 = ~While I do not doubt that men exist with greed enough to sabotage their own if the price is right, it is very unlike goblins to use such cunning. That may be evidence of some larger power behind this army.~
@11743 = ~Yes ma'am. Sorry ma'am. Won't do it again ma'am. Sorry. Sorry.~
@11744 = ~Gods alive... I'm having flashbacks to my own deceased mother. (At least that old shrew had the decency to die before she could completely emasculate me...)~
@11745 = ~Your mother died? Why haven't you ever mentioned that? Oh that's so sad...~
@11746 = ~Oh but my Skie, you musn't worry for me. The strength I have from my loss lets me better find a future for us and when I think of her burning in... err I mean watching us from the heavens, it puts a smile to my face.~
@11747 = ~Eldoth... Ohhh! You're so thoughtful and sweet!~
@11748 = ~This woman is relentless. Perhaps we should just sick her against the goblins? No doubt she'd have them apologizing and going home before supper.~
@11749 = ~Ah tis the sight you have. Mine own eyes percieve'st much that is beyond what the senses should have. I knowest well the burden that bringst to those who have it. I apologize if we has't caused any offense.~
@11750 = ~Bah, did yer sight rob ya of those senses? Does it bring pain to ya each day? Have ye ever had an ungrateful son that spends all'a his days at sea instead of takin' care o' his dear mum? Ye can stuff yer notions of sisterhood.~
@11751 = ~Some days, I miss my homeland greatly. *sigh* This is one of those days.~
@11752 = ~Tis a tragedy I know well of. I'd love to hear the tale but perhaps from a performer who sings more like a dove or osprey and less like an abyssal vrock.~
@11753 = ~Yeah, gotta admit there boss, carrying around a dead cat might be a new level of creepy. Makes you come off like one of those weird hoarder people...~
@11754 = ~Oh that's just one of <CHARNAME>'s lovable quirks. <PRO_HESHE> just has to add everything that ain't nailed down to <PRO_HISHER>'s pack. We probably should have an intervention at some point...~
@11755 = ~I thought you had stored that animal to consume it later. You -will- consume it, yes? Nature's creatures should not die in vain!~
@11756 = ~Ah that could be none other than Sigil, the finest city in all the planes in the estimation of this humble sparrow. A true majesty of the outer planes and often infested by the razorvine plant which also matches your description. The glacier of black... perhaps the river Styx as it cascades down Acheron... ~
@11757 = ~Ye talkin in gibberish boy, speak plainly.~
@11758 = ~Mmm, perhaps I will sit out the rest of this conversation in reverie instead. Her manner is giving this sparrow a most severe headache.~
@11759 = ~Yes, the evils of civilization have long plagued that tree, perpetuated by foolish druidic sects that believe that fostering communities under it will not taint its beauty to the roots.~
@11760 = ~It is a great shame but nature can never remain independent when such evils arise. Its power will always draw and be drawn to those who would misuse it or through misuse of other powers bring collateral damage upon it.~
@11761 = ~Pretty good story, but it was lacking romance. If it were my story I would have two of the adventurers, a brave aspiring poet and a lady paladin of unparalleled virtue, find love on the road. There's no better story than the blossoming of love while lives are in mortal peril.~
@11762 = ~Oops. Busted. Uhh... well can't say I feel great about this one. I mean, robbing from an elderly blind woman is bad enough, but being caught? Makes me want to go take a nap.~
@11763 = ~But but... there were shinies and I... ohhh now I feel awful...~
@11764 = ~Wait now, did one of ye rob this woman? Have ye no decency? Oh I'll have to pray twice as hard to Clangeddin today ta be rid of the guilt...~
@11765 = ~<CHARNAME> how could you? For shame... for shame indeed (how's a guy supposed to know he's stealing from a sighted woman?)~
@11766 = ~<CHARNAME>, you know I'm not one to preach about the virtues of not robbing your elders, as that seems entirely self-evident, but I do hope you at least give some thought about what you've done.~
@11767 = ~Aren't barmen the ones that are supposed to be in the know about everything going on in town? Seems this one's an exception to the rule.~
@11768 = ~Ignorance, Gohar be thy name.~
@11769 = ~You rid him of a leech and he demands you open your vein to replace the blood he lost? Surfacer gratitude never ceases to amaze me.~
@11770 = ~It doesn't sound like you kept your word when they wanted you to help defend. It sounds like you're just making excuses.~
@11771 = ~Now there missy, don't pout. The details of that aren't important besides.~
@11772 = ~Yer talkin' to one right here. Yer big on talk but me own guts be easily a match fer yers.~
@11773 = ~I don't think so. I may be a great bear of a northerner, but I'm no fool -- I've seen your kind tip back kegs without so much as blinking.  I'm not going to wager my charm on racing a dwarf to the tavern floor.~
@11774 = ~Yer a milk-lily coward and not worth the trouble of pullin' me axes out.~
@11775 = ~Pff, this human thinks he can match up against dwarven constitution? Put your wolf charm on the table, this will be easier than getting charity money from a paladin.~
@11776 = ~Ya damn ingrate! To hell with ya.~
@11777 = ~Ah yes, fetch errands. The bane of every young adventuring party. Let us hope we are not burdened with such tedium while we are here.~
@11778 = ~With better leadership, they would know to put the experienced adventurers on sortees or running drills with the weaker groups. Such chores are demeaning.~
@11779 = ~Oh Khalid, please remember to pick up the herbs on this list when we settle at an inn so I can make an ointment for your rash. Also a new shirt for yourself. I swear, I do not know how you sweat so in this cold.~
@11780 = ~Y-yes dear.~
@11781 = ~A dagger?? A DAGGER? Your gift offends Tiax! He commands you to stick this dagger in your own eye in penitence.~
@11782 = ~I uhh... would rather not.~
@11783 = ~Insolent traitor! Tiax's eternal mark of shame upon you!~
@11784 = ~Ye got care for yer craft and are willin' ta defend it with steel. Clangeddin's blessins on ye.~
@11785 = ~A priest of Clangeddin? We don't get many of our kind out here. Glad to see someone holding our people's faith among us.~
@11786 = ~Aha! Perhaps you are berserkers like Minsc and Boo! As Boo can tell you, it is not your size that counts, but your hamster-like ferocity! Though being big certainly does not hurt. Boo can only wield a sword that fits his tiny hamster paws.~
@11787 = ~Shapin' wood? But how do ye forge it without burnin' it ta ash or shatterin' it ta splinters with yer hammer?~
@11788 = ~Clangeddin never did demand those with exceptional smarts tae serve him...~
@11789 = ~I've often thought about making a small boat when I can finally settle down. It would be a nice project to spend the summer hours on.~
@11790 = ~Ye fashion yerself an amatuer shipwright?~
@11791 = ~No, I just enjoy woodworking as a hobby. It would be a small boat if anything, just for taking out onto a lake, perhaps do some fishing.~
@11792 = ~Ah, aye. But still, come speak to me if ye will when the attack is done and mayhaps I can give ye some tips fer yer fishin' boat.~
@11793 = ~I'd appreciate that.~
@11794 = ~How adorably domestic of you.~
@11795 = ~Quiet, drow.~
@11796 = ~Sounds like *somebody's* not getting invited to the boat party...~
@11797 = ~I assure you that we would not take unless our need was great and the very city itself at stake. If necessary I'm certain we can compensate you afterwards if...~
@11798 = ~Nah, it's fine. You're putting your own lives in danger, I'm not so miserly I'll not contribute as well in what way I can.~
@11799 = ~<CHARNAME>, don't you think we might be well equipped enough to not need to scavenge among rusty weaponry?~
@11800 = ~Debatably competent adventurers versus moldy, desiccated barrels. Round one, fight!~
@11801 = ~Why, this reminds me of an authentic Jansen ritual children play at celebrations called Griffata. In Griffata you take a griffin (generally made out of folded paper, but your local taxidermist will surely appreciate the business if you can snag a real one) and stuff it with baked and boiled turnips. Then you hang it up and blindfold and stick a clothesline on the nose of one lucky tyke who then must beat the griffin with a griffata stick until it splits open, showering those delectable treats on the children as they squeal in delight. Never has a Jansen child enjoyed such prominent social standing on the playground as they have after a round of Griffata.~
@11802 = ~Jan, do other gnomes even like turnips?~
@11803 = ~Well, not as much as a Jansen to be sure. But for the children less enthused with the taste of a freshly baked turnip (gods be merciful to their souls) they were sure to enjoy the followup game where they hurled these vegetables at the Jansen. It's a popularity of another sort.~
@11804 = ~*sniff* He's bleeding quite badly. Not really my type though.~
@11805 = ~I can help him. Just let me tend to his arm and it will be good as new. Oh please let me help.~
@11806 = ~Tempus will be happy to lend me his aid to heal a warrior thus injured.~

@2050 = ~What a strange place. It seems to be some sort of observatory for creatures of fin and gill. But frozen over. I am unfamiliar with much of the subjects on display... even to one as studied in fauna as I, the sea holds many mysteries to me.~
@2051 = ~Gah! Why would anyone display creatures like this! It is like one of those... zoo things. A mercy at least that the ice has claimed them and they do not have to endure the shame of prying eyes.~
